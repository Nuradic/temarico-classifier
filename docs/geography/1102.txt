The earth’s surface is not uniform due to variation in its geological formation. 
As a result, we observe altitudinal variation between places. The major geologic 
events that have taken place during the geological history of the earth have left 
varied landforms such as plateaus, mountains, hills, valleys and plains. These 
uneven landforms with different heights are represented on maps with the help 
of contour lines.
The relief features of the earth have three dimensions. These are length, breadth, 
and height. These three-dimensional features are represented on two-dimensional 
maps. Traditionally, hachuring, hill shading, layer tinting and form lines used to 
be used to show the varied landforms of the earth. However, they are no longer 
in use these days as they are replaced by contour lines.
In this unit, you are going to learn about how relief features, drainage patterns, 
and human-made features are represented on contour maps. In addition, the unit 
will try to introduce you to some concepts of Geographic Information System 
(GIS), including its essence, history and uses.

2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map
What is relief? What is cartography? 
The term relief refers to the way that the earth’s surface is arranged. It shows the 
difference in altitude that exists between different landforms. Relief indicates the 
variation in the nature of the land surface (i.e., “the lie of the land”). It thus shows 
the broad features and relative heights of highlands and lowlands such as flood 
plains, spurs, hills, plateaus etc. As we know, mountains have higher altitudes than 
hills. Similarly, plateaus are higher in altitude than plains. Such a difference in 
altitude produces diverse topographic features on the earth’s surface. As a result, 
we have valleys, depressions, plains, plateaus, hills, and mountains constituting 
the earth’s topography. These features of the earth’s surface need to be represented 
by using different techniques while mapping the earth. Currently, the most widely 
used relief-representation cartographic technique is using contour lines.
Brainstorming
1 What are contour lines?
2 How do they represent different landforms on maps?
3 How are contour lines drawn?
4 What are the methods and procedures applied to represent landforms on maps?
Contour lines, also known as isohypses, are imaginary lines shown on a map that 
connect places of equal altitude above mean sea level. They provide the most 
accurate way of showing relief on maps. Contours are used to show the different 
landforms of the earth on two-dimensional maps. They help cartographers to 
easily show the depressions, valleys, hills, mountains, plains and plateaus by 
using contours with varying shapes and distances between consecutive contours. 
For instance, the shapes of the contour lines provide an accurate representation 
of the shapes of hills and depressions, and the lines themselves show the actual 
elevations. In addition, while closely spaced contour lines indicate steep slopes, 
the widely spaced ones indicate gentle slopes.
Contours are one of the several common methods used to denote elevation 
or altitude and depth on maps. From a contour map, a sense of the general 
terrain can be determined. Contours are used at a variety of scales, from largescale engineering drawings and architectural plans, through topographic 
maps up to continental-scale maps.
The term “contour line” is most commonly used in cartography. However, the 
term “isobath” for underwater depths on bathymetric maps and “isohypse” 
for elevations are also used. The process of drawing contours (isohypses) on a 
map is called isopletion.

2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map 2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map
Look at the following contour map and try to identify the general pattern and the 
arrangement of each contour line.
The different topographic features that characterize landscapes are shown on 
topographic maps by using contours with various characteristics. The patterns that 
the contours are drawn with, their spacing and shape indicate the characteristics 
of the relief of the place. As a result, valleys, spurs, shoulders, plains, plateaus, 
mountain tops, different types of slope, cliffs, overhanging cliffs, mountain ranges, 
and depressions are represented by contours of different shapes on topographic 
maps. For instance,
F Evenly spaced contours represent a uniform slope; 
F Contours that are widely spaced indicate a gentle slope; 
F Contours that are close together near the top of a hill and widely spaced 
at the bottom indicate a concave slope; 
F Contours that are widely spaced at the top of a hill and close together 
at the bottom indicate a convex slope;
F Overlapping contours, i.e., contours that merge at a point, indicate a 
cliff;
Figure 2.1: Contour Map
Grade 11 Geography 28
2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map
F Crossing contours indicate an overhanging cliff;
F Closed contours with more or less circular shapes, with values increasing 
towards the center and with the top indicated by a spot height represent 
mountains or hills;
F Closed contours with more or less circular shapes, with values 
decreasing towards the center represent depressions;
F Closed contours with elongated shapes, with values increasing towards 
the center with no specific tips indicate mountain ranges;
F Closed contours with more or less rectangular shapes, with values 
increasing towards the center with the top being a very wide closed 
contour represent plateaus; 
F Contours with “V” shapes, with downward bending and values 
increasing upward represent spurs; and 
F Contours with “V” shapes, with upward bending and values increasing 
upward represent valleys.
The relief of a place represents the varying heights of hills and mountains, and 
the depths of valleys and gorges as they appear on a topographic map. Unless the 
relief is adequately shown, the map does not give a clear picture of the mapped 
area. In the earliest maps, relief was often indicated pictorially by small drawings 
of mountains and valleys known as pictorials. However, this method is extremely 
inaccurate and has been generally replaced by a system of contour lines. The 
contour lines represent points in the mapped area that are of equal elevations. 
They are drawn with a contour interval that may be any unit, depending on the 
amount of relief and the scale of the map, such as 50 or 100 m, and in drawing the 
map the cartographer joins together all points that are at a height of 50 or 100 m 
above sea level, all points at a height of 100 or 200 m, all points at a height of 150 
or 300 m, and so on. Being drawn in such a way, the shapes of the contour lines 
provide an accurate representation of the shapes of hills and depressions, and the 
lines themselves show the actual elevations. The spacing between contour lines 
also indicates the nature of the slopes.

2.1.1 Drawing Contour Lines from Spot 
Heights
Brainstorming 
1 How are contours drawn?
2 How is spatial information concerning the area being represented by contour 
maps obtained?
3 Do you think that aerial photographs/images taken by aircraft and artificial 
satellites can be used in contour mapping? How? 
4 How do cartographers draw contour lines from spot heights? 
Contours are drawn on maps based on the spatial data that is gathered through 
different techniques. This is to mean that before preparing the contour map of 
an area, surveying the area to obtain spatial data about the relief of the place is 
important. The collection of spatial information that is vital for contour mapping 
can be done through ground survey, aerial photography or satellite imagery. 
When the surveying is done by using aircraft and satellites (through aerial 
photography/imagery), the aerial photograph of the landscape has to be 
mapped through aerial photogrammetry, which uses an instrument called a 
stereoscope. Photogrammetry is the science of taking measurements from 
aerial photographs or satellite images to make maps, including topographic maps. 
Photogrammetrists use photographs taken by a special camera on an airplane or 
Grade 11 Geography 30
2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map
by spacecraft satellites. To minimize distortions, the pictures are corrected using 
a stereoscopic device called a stereoplotter, which creates a three-dimensional 
image by combining overlapping pictures of the same terrain taken from two 
different angles. Contours, roads, and other features are then traced from the 
three-dimensional image to form a map base. 
The photographs with horizontal and vertical information of the area will then 
be reconstructed into stereo models for drafting true-scale maps. In this method, 
precise cameras and precision-mapping equipment are required to show true 
elevations for all points in the mapped area. Elevations on topographic maps are 
shown chiefly by use of superimposed contour lines connecting points of equal 
elevation, to give a readable picture of the terrain.
On the other hand, when spatial information is gathered through ground 
surveys, surveyors must physically be present in the area being mapped and take 
measurements of the relief and keep records of their measurements of height. 
Then, the gathered data will be recorded on paper or stored in a computer by 
using spot heights, with each spot height representing the measured altitude of 
the specific point. Then, the cartographers/map-makers will connect all points 
of equal altitude to draw the contours with the contour interval that they choose 
based on the nature of the landscape and the scale of the map. 
Drawing contours from spot heights is tiresome and time-consuming. However, 
it is important for producing contour maps in situations where advanced 
technologies of contour mapping are not adequately available. Contours are 
drawn from spot heights by using the method called interpolation to determine 
the height of places between successive spot heights. Spot heights represent 
individual heights of places at varying points as obtained through ground surveys 
A stereoscope is an optical instrument through which one may view 
photographs of objects not merely as plane representations, but with an 
appearance of solidity, and in relief. The stereoscope is an instrument in 
which two photographs of the same object, taken from slightly different 
angles, are simultaneously presented, one to each eye. Each picture is 
focused by a separate lens, and the two lenses are inclined so as to shift 
the images toward each other and thus ensure the visual combination of 
the two images into one three-dimensional image. Stereoscopic aerial 
photography permits three-dimensional representations, which can be 
used in the preparation of contour maps.

by using clinometers, which are hand held surveying instruments for measuring 
angles of slopes, and altimeters, instruments to measure the elevations of places.
Activity 2.2
Discuss the following questions with your friend and try to answer them 
collaboratively.
1 How can you determine the points at which each contour line with a 100 m 
contour interval passes?
2 How do cartographers obtain spatial data for their mapping?
Interpolation can be done in any one of the following ways.
F Estimation method: This technique is used to locate contour lines by 
rough estimation. It should be applied in areas where the ground is 
quite regular and when very simple and small-scale work is done. It 
does not necessarily need great accuracy.
F Calculation method: This is the most accurate method of interpolation, 
whereby the exact altitude of the contour will be determined by 
measurement and subsequent calculations. Despite its accuracy, the 
calculation method is time-consuming and laborious. 
F Graphical method: This is the quickest and the most accurate method 
of interpolation of contours. In the graphic method, a graph is prepared 
on tracing paper.
Methods of Depicting Relief on Maps
How are different relief features represent on maps?
Map makers use several methods to depict relief of the terrain.
a Layer Tinting: Layer tinting is a method of showing relief by using 
different colours or different intensities of the same colour. Each shade of 
colour, or band, represents a definite elevation range. To understand the 
relief, a legend is printed on the map margin. However, this method does 
not allow the map user to determine the exact elevation of a specific point. 
It only shows the range of elevation.
b Form Lines: Form lines are not measured from any datum plane. As a 
result, they have no standard elevation. They only give a general idea of 
Grade 11 Geography 32
2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map
relief represented. Form lines are represented on a map as dashed lines and 
are never labeled with representative elevations.
c Shaded Relief: Relief shading is a method that indicates relief by a shadow 
effect achieved by tone and colour that results in the darkening of one side 
of terrain features, such as hills and ridges. The darker the shading, the 
steeper the slope. Shaded relief is sometimes used in conjunction with 
contour lines to emphasize these features.
d Hachures: Hachures are short, broken lines that are used to show relief. 
They are sometimes used with contour lines. Hachures do not represent 
exact elevations, but are mainly used to show large, rocky outcrop areas. 
Hachures are widely used on small-scale maps to show mountain ranges, 
plateaus, and mountain peaks.
e Contour Lines: A contour line represents an imaginary line on the ground, 
representing altitude above or below mean sea level. Contour lines are 
the most common method of showing relief and elevation on a standard 
topographic map. All points on a given contour line are at the same 
elevation. The elevation represented by contour lines show the vertical 
distance above or below mean sea level. Cartographers use three types of 
contour lines while representing relief on topographic maps. 
The three types of contour lines used on a standard topographic map are the 
following.
1 Index Contour: Starting from zero elevation or mean sea level, every 
fifth contour line is a heavier/darker than the other contour lines. These 
heavier contour lines are called index contour lines. Commonly, each 
index contour line is numbered at some point. This number indicates the 
elevation of that line.
Supplementary
400 Index
Intermediate
Figure 2.2: The three types of contour lines
Unit 2: Map reading and Interpretation 33
2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map 2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map
2 Intermediate Contour: The contour lines falling between the index contour 
lines are called intermediate contour lines. These lines are finer/thinner 
than the index contours. They do not have their elevations given. In most 
cases, there are four intermediate contour lines between index contour lines. 
Their value is decided by dividing the difference in altitude between two 
consecutive index contours by five, if there are four intermediate contours.
3 Supplementary Contour: These contour lines resemble dashed or broken 
lines. They show changes in elevation of at least one-half the contour 
interval. These lines are normally found where there is very little change in 
elevation, such as on fairly level terrain.
Contour lines are generated from spot heights. A spot height is a statistical point 
that represents the specific altitude of a place at that particular point. Drawing 
contours from spot heights is not hard or difficult. However, it needs a lot of 
practice and patience, as well as a lot of time, to make a good-looking contour 
map. 
Contouring is started by plotting the spot heights with their specific altitudes 
on the paper on which you want to draw the contour map. The elevations of the 
spot heights can be obtained by ground survey and associated measurement of 
altitude of points on the surveyed area. Figure 2.3 shows you an area in which the 
altitudes of the selected points are shown by using spot heights.
As you can see from Figure 2.3, the altitudes of a number of places have been 
collected through ground survey and the altitude of each point is presented by 
using mathematical calculation.

Grade 11 Geography 34
2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map
As shown in the Figure 2.3, the contour interval is 100 m. This means that 
contours are drawn for every 100 m altitude. The lowest point indicated by the 
spot heights in the figure is 300 m above sea level. Hence, the contour line with 
the lowest value is the 300 m contour. By starting from that line, contours have 
to be drawn for every additional 100 m altitude. Accordingly, you are expected 
to draw contours for 400 m, 500 m, 600 m, and the like up to the highest point 
indicated, which is 1070 m. In this case, the last contour line should have a value 
of 1000 m as the contour interval given is 100 m.
The second step in drawing contours from spot heights is determining the 
approximate points through which the contour lines with every 100 m value 
pass. This can be done by using the method called interpolation. Interpolation 
is a method of estimating the values of points lying between two points that 
have defined values. By using this method, we can scientifically guess the 
approximate altitude through which each contour line with an additional 100 m 
altitude passes. Interpolation involves some kind of mathematical measurement. 
To determine the points at which the contour is to be drawn and pass through, we 
have to connect points between which the contour lines of every 100 m additional 
value pass by using straight lines. Then, the length of the straight line is measured 
by using a ruler to obtain the distance on the map between the points. Once the 
distance on the map between the points is acquired, we have to apply a crossmultiplication system to get the point at which the required contour with a 100 m 
contour interval should pass. We apply similar procedures to plot all the points 
for each specific contour line.
To better understand the procedures that we apply while interpolating points, you 
can study the following figure and the associated description. The figure shows 
you the procedures that we need to follow while determining the points at which 
the 400 m contour line passes. To do so, follow this procedure.
1 Identify all the points between which the 400 m contour line passes. In this 
case, they are all the points that lie between the following spot heights.
F 320 m and 420 m
F 350 m and 420 m
F 350 m and 450 m

F 380 m and 410 m
F 380 m and 450 m
Unit 2: Map reading and Interpretation 35
2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map 2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map
2 Connect all the points identified above by using straight lines as shown 
in Figure 2.4. The lines are drawn connecting those spot heights between 
which the 400 m contour line is expected to pass. To draw the whole map, 
you should connect all the spot heights between which a contour line with 
a 100 m contour interval would pass.
3 Measure the length of each line connecting two spot heights to 
determine the distance on the map between the two points and 
see the height it represents (the difference in altitude between the 
two spot heights). For example, the distance on the map between 
the 320 m and 420 m spot heights is measured and is found to be 
1.5 cm. This means that the 100 m altitudinal difference between the 320 m 
and 420 m spot heights is represented by a 1.5 cm straight line.
4 Determine the point at which the 400 m contour line passes. This can be 
done by using the cross-multiplication method. For example, if the 1.5 cm 
represents 100 m between the 320 m and 420 m spot heights, then the 
length of line that represents 80 m from the lowest spot height, i.e., 320 m, 
would be 1.2 cm.
5 Put a point at a distance of 1.2 cm from the 320 m spot height along the line 
that connects the 320 m and 420 m spot heights to identify the point along 
which the 400 m contour line passes. 
N.B: Apply the procedures above to determine the points at which each contour 
line with a 100 m contour interval passes between two spot heights.
6 Connect all the identified points of a certain contour line with the given 
contour interval by using curved lines to draw the contours. While doing 
so, please consider the shapes and patterns that different features such as 
rivers have when they are represented on contour maps. This will help you 
to better represent the features on your map.

2.1.2 Drawing Relief Cross-Section (Profile)
Brainstorming
1 What is a cross-section? 
2 How are cross-sections drawn? 
3 Why are cross-sections drawn?
As we have seen so far, contouring is the standard method of representing relief 
on topographic maps. For a given contour map the vertical distance between 
adjacent contour lines – the contour interval – is fixed. Examining the horizontal 
distance between succeeding contour lines helps the reader to visually estimate 
the difference in slope of parts of the terrain. Thus, the way the contours are 
arranged, their shapes and spacing shows the diverse relief features of the area 
mapped. While closely spaced contour lines represent steep slopes, widely spaced 
contours show gentle slopes.
However, a more precise method of determining the variation in slope is to 
construct a profile or cross-section through the topography. This is done by 
marking off the horizontal distance between contour lines along a base line and 
then plotting the elevation or altitude of these points. By doing so, a profile can 
be drawn showing the gradient of slope and shape of the topography along the 
line of section. 
Cross-section drawing is one of the simplest ways of acquiring skills in reading 
contour maps. A cross-section helps us to acquire a better view of the nature of 
the slope and other relief features drawn on the contour map. When we draw the 
cross-section of a map, we can have a better understanding of the nature of the 
landscape and can tell whether two points are intervisible or not. 
In order to draw a cross-section from a given contour map, we need to have a 
vertical scale in addition to the horizontal scale of the map. Horizontal scale is 
the normal scale of any given map. On the other hand, vertical scale is the scale 
which is used to show the nature and type of relief on the contour map. It shows 
the degree of exaggeration made while the cross-section of a relief feature is 
prepared from its contour map.
The vertical exaggeration/vertical scale of the cross-section is determined by 
considering the scale of the map and the nature of the terrain. Although the decision 
Grade 11 Geography 38
2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map
concerning the extent to which a cross-section should be exaggerated is in the hands 
of the one who prepares the cross-section, the widely accepted approach to use is 
defined by these guidelines:
F higher vertical exaggeration for flat terrain; and
F small or no vertical exaggeration for rugged (rough) terrain.

2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map 2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map
The first part of Figure 2.12 shows the topography of the mapped area in a 
contour-line map. The contours are labeled with numbers indicating how high 
above sea level the contours are. The second part of the figure is a cross-section 
of the contour map along the line A-B. The x-axis (the horizontal axis) of the 
cross-section corresponds to the line from A to B on the topographical map. The 
y-axis (the vertical axis) of the cross-section is used with the x-axis to plot the 
height of each contour where it crosses the A-B line. In this way, a series of dots 
has been created and they have been connected to each other to create the crosssection of the landscape.
From the above cross-section, one can easily understand that the area represented 
by the contour map is a pass between two rising landforms/hills. It is also possible 
to see the nature of the slope along the sides of the hills. For instance, the hills 
are steeper along the left side, while they are gentler along the right. Note that the 
steeper slopes are represented by closely drawn contours, while the gentler slopes 
are represented by contours that are widely spaced.

In almost all cross-sections, the horizontal scale is smaller than the 
vertical scale. This forms a simple relationship between the contour 
interval and the vertical distance between the horizontal lines on the 
graph paper. For instance, a section from the 1 cm thus plotted on 1
cm
10
would have a horizontal scale of 1
cm
100,000
 and a vertical scale of 
( ) 1 1cm to 10,000cm 10,000 . The vertical exaggeration would be approximately 
10 times.

While drawing the cross-section of an area, using a vertical scale may be 
required. This becomes a must if the map is drawn in such a way that may 
result in inconvenient cross-sections. Using a vertical scale greater than the 
horizontal scale in a cross-section is called vertical exaggeration. Cartographers 
exaggerate the vertical scale in order to clearly visualize the terrain of an area. 
Some times less exaggeration is used in areas where the relief elevation is high. 
When the relief represented is a relatively flat area or an area of low altitude, 
more exaggeration is needed. 
The degree to which we exaggerate the vertical scale (V.E.) depends on:
F the scale of the map from which the profile is drawn
F the relief configuration of the area that we are dealing with.
Vertical exaggeration is both advantageous and disadvantageous. Some of the 
advantages and limitations of vertical exaggeration are listed below.
Advantages 
F it increases the visual 
effectiveness of a given relief.
F it has the potential to give a 
very strong impression. 
Disadvantages
F it causes the slope of a 
hillside to look steeper than 
it actually is.
F it may cause some distortion.
Focus 
When we draw a cross-section, we have to show graphically the proportions 
between horizontal and vertical distances. When we want to show the 
profile of a given piece of land, the variations in altitude are very small 
when compared with the horizontal distances involved.

2.1.3 Intervisibility
Brainstorming
1 What do we mean by intervisibility? 
2 Why is it important to study the intervisibility of places? 
3 What are the factors that affect intervisibility?
Intervisibility is simply defined as the visibility of places to each other. If an 
observer standing at a certain point can see another observer standing at another 
point, then the two places are said to be intervisible. Any land that is not visible 
from a certain point or place is known as “dead ground” relative to that area. 
Contour maps are important tools to determine whether two places are intervisible 
or not. An important feature of contour maps is that they allow us to know whether 
one place can be seen from another and vice versa.
Studying intervisibility is important for many reasons, for example
F Intervisibility is important for planning military operations;
F It is also important for understanding the distribution of dead and 
visible ground with respect to proposed plans of infrastructure;
F Intervisibility provides information for the evaluation of proposed sites 
for forest-fire lookouts;
F Intervisibility plays a significant role in the planning of logging; and
F It is important for selecting appropriate sites for the development of 
recreation and refreshment centers.
The intervisibility of places can be affected by several factors, amongst which the 
most important ones are the following.
i The type of slope between the two points;
ii The general relief between the two points; and
iii The amount of vegetation that covers the area.
When we study intervisibility from contour maps, we have to consider the 
characteristics of contour lines. This is so because contour lines with varying 
shapes and patterns represent varied relief features. As we know, the nature of 
the landscape is the most important determining factor regarding intervisibility. 
Accordingly, we can say that under normal conditions,
Unit 2: Map reading and Interpretation 45
2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map 2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map
F Two points separated by an even slope are said to be intervisible. 
However, in such a case, the vegetation cover should be taken into 
consideration before we make our decision. If the slope is covered with 
forest, the two points may not be intervisible;
F Two points having unequal heights but separated by ground lower than 
the lower ground of the two points are intervisible;
F Two points of equal altitude may or may not be intervisible, depending 
on other factors. For example, the two become intervisible if there is no 
higher ground or thick vegetation cover between the two points;
F Two points separated by a concave slope are said to be intervisible if no 
other factor exists that hinders intervisibility; 
F Two points separated by a convex slope are not intervisible to each 
other because there is out-bulging land between the points;
F Two points that are located at the opposite sides of high ground are not 
intervisible because the higher ground between the two obscures their 
intervisibility.
For example, in the following contour map (Figure 2.15), the intervisibility of 
points A and B and C and D can be determined by observing the nature of the 
contour lines and the direction at which elevation increases. Accordingly, we can 
conclude that:
a Points A and B are not intervisible. As a result, the men standing 
at the two points cannot see each other. This is due to the presence 
of higher ground between the two points. As you can see from the 
map, the persons stand at the opposite sides of the hill. Point A lies at 
60 m altitude, while point B is at 70 m altitude, but there is ground 
higher than 80 m in altitude between the two. This obscures their 
intervisibility.
b Points C and D are intervisible and therefore the men standing at 
the two points can see each other. In this case, the two persons are 
standing on the same side of the hill but at different altitudes. As 
shown on the map, point C lies at an altitude of 90 m, while point 
D is located at an altitude of 60 m. As there is no higher ground 
between the two points, and as the slope is gentle, the two places are 
intervisible. 
F due to the type of the slope = concave 
Grade 11 Geography 46
2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map
The intervisibility of places can easily be determined when the places shown on 
the contour map are presented in cross-section. The most important purpose of 
drawing cross-sections is to determine the intervisibility of places. For instance, 
the intervisibility of the points shown on the above contour map can be easily 
decided by observing the nature of the landscape between the labeled points in 
the following cross-section diagram of the contour map presented above.

While determining the intervisibility of points or places labelled on a contour 
map, knowing the following facts simplifies your work. However, do not forget 
that these conditions are functional only under normal condition. This is to mean 
that there should not be any other factors, such as thick vegetation, that may 
hinder the intervisibility of the points. 
1 Points located at different altitudes (for example, one at the top and the 
other at the bottom of a hill) with contours that are drawn close to each 
other at the top and farther apart at the bottom (i.e., concave slopes) are 
intervisible. 
2 Two points, one located at the top and the other at the bottom of a hill, with 
contours that are drawn far apart at the top and close to each other at the 
bottom (i.e., convex slopes) are not intervisible.

4 Two points, one being located on top of a cliff or an overhanging cliff 
and the other at the bottom of it (a relief feature that is represented by 
contours that merge at the points where the landscape becomes a cliff) are 
not intervisible. 
5 Points that are located at the same altitude are intervisible if there is no 
higher ground between the points. Otherwise, they are not intervisible. 
 
6 Two points that are located at the opposite sides of a hill or a mountain 
(represented by nearly circular closed contours with their values increasing 
towards the smaller (innermost) closed contour) are not intervisible to 
each other because the higher ground between the two points prevents 
intervisibility.

7 Two points, one located inside a depression on top of a mountain and 
the other on the side of the mountain outside the depression (shown by 
nearly circular closed contours with their values increasing towards the 
top of the mountain up to the beginning of the depression and then closed 
contours with their values decreasing towards the most interior point) are 
not intervisible. 
The intervisibility of two points can also be determined by using a skeleton 
diagram that shows only the altitude of the points for which intervisibility is 
to be investigated. Figure 2.25 gives you some idea about how to determine 
intervisibility between points by using this technique. Such a method is especially 
important for determining intervisibility between points when, for some reason, 
it is difficult to determine intervisibility by using contour maps.

In the above section, we find that the line of vision drawn from A to B is 
obscured by the height of D (960 m), and therefore the two points A and B are 
not intervisible. This can also be decided by the very position of D and B. If spot 
height D had been closer to C, or if point B had been farther away from D, points 
A, B, and D would have been intervisible. Therefore, the intervisibility of points 
on such landforms cannot be decided with the help of the contour map unless we 
use a skeleton section like the above one.

2.1.4 LandForms on Contour Maps
What sort of merit does contour lines have for showing land features on maps? 
How do we identify different land features with the help of contour lines? How 
do you identify different slopes on contour maps? 
Contour maps show different relief features by using contour lines with different 
shapes and spacing. Their patterns help map readers to easily identify the kind 
of terrain feature represented. For instance, mountains and plateaus are shown 
by contour lines with different shapes. The same thing is true when valleys and 
depressions are represented. As a result, various terrains on contour maps appear 
with their own distinct shape and pattern. Map makers exploit this advantage 
of contour lines to depict the nature of the landforms they show on their maps. 
The following discussion gives you some ideas about how different terrains are 
represented on topographic maps.
1 Hill: A hill is an area of high ground but is lower than a mountain in 
elevation. From the top of the hill the ground slopes down in all directions. 
On a topographic map, a hill is shown by contour lines forming concentric 
circles. The inside of the smallest closed circle indicates the hilltop. The 
following figure shows you how a hill is represented on a contour map.
F Col is a relatively lower and deeper than saddle often found between 
two streams. 
F Pass is a deeper, more pronounced depression than a col between two 
hills or mountains. 
2 Saddle: A saddle is a dip or low point between two areas of higher ground. 
The feature is like the seat on a riding horse. It is not necessarily the lower 
ground between two hilltops. It can rather be a simple dip or break along 
a level ridge crest. A saddle has high ground in two opposite directions. A 
saddle is normally represented as an hourglass.

2.1 Relief Representation On Contour Map
3 Valley: A valley is a long low-lying area of land, often with a river or stream 
running through it, that is surrounded by higher ground. It is a stretchedout channel in the land, usually formed by streams or rivers. A valley 
begins with high ground on three sides, and usually has a course of running 
water through it. In a valley, three directions offer high ground, while the 
fourth direction offers low ground. Contour lines forming a valley are 
either U-shaped or V-shaped. While U-shaped contours represent valleys 
with steep slopes and flat bottoms, V-shaped contours show valleys with 
relatively gently descending slopes with V-shaped bottoms. To determine 
the direction water is flowing, look at the contour lines. The closed end of 
the contour line (U or V) always points upstream or toward high ground.
4 Ridge: A ridge is a sloping line of high ground. It is a long narrow hill top 
or a range of hills. A ridge normally has low ground in three directions 
and high ground in one direction with varying degrees of slope. Crossing 
a ridge at right angles results in climbing steeply to the top and then 
descending steeply to the bottom. Contour lines representing a ridge tend to

be U-shaped or V-shaped. The closed end of the contour line points toward 
lower ground.
5 Depression: A depression is an area of land that is lower in altitude than the 
areas surrounding it. It is a low point on the ground or a sinkhole. It could 
also be described as an area of low ground surrounded by higher ground in 
all directions, or simply as a hole in the ground. Usually only depressions 
that are equal to or greater than the contour interval will be shown. On 
maps, depressions are represented by closed contour lines that have tick 
marks pointing downward to lower ground.

What is a re-intrant? What is the difference between a re-intrant and a spur? 
6 Re-intrant: A re-intrant is a less-developed stream course that is smaller 
than a valley. It has no level ground and, therefore, little or no movement 
room within its limits. In a re-intrant, the ground slopes upward in three 
directions and downward in the other direction. A re-intrant could be 
considered as the initial stage in the formation of a valley. Like those 
representing a valley, the contour lines representing a draw are U-shaped 
or V-shaped, pointing toward higher ground.
What is a spur? What makes it different from a valley? 
7 Spur: A spur is a short and continuously sloping line of higher ground that 
normally extends out from the side of a ridge. Usually, a spur is formed by 
two roughly parallel streams that cut draws along the side of a ridge. A spur 
has three of its sides sloping downwards and upward sloping on the other 
direction. Spurs are shown on a contour map by using contours that point 
towards the lower ground with “U” or “V” shapes. 
What is a cliff? How it is shown in a contour map?

8 Cliff: A cliff is a vertical or nearly vertical relief feature with a sudden 
change vertical distance (elevation) with almost no change in its horizontal 
distance. Cliffs are shown on topographic maps by using contour lines that 
are very close together (when there is a little change in horizontal distance 
and rapid increase in vertical distance) and, in some cases, by contours that 
overlap (merge) when there is no change in horizontal distance at all.
Supplementary Terrain Features
1 Cut: A cut is a human-made feature that results from the cutting of higher 
ground, usually to form a level bed for a road or railway track. Cuts are 
shown on a map when they are at least 10 m high. They are usually drawn 
with a contour line along the cut line. The contour line extends the length 
of the cut and has tick marks that extend from the cut line to the road bed, 
if the map scale permits this level of detail.
2 Fill: is a human made feature resulting from filling a low area usually to 
form a level bed for a road or rail road track. Fills are shown on a map when 
they are at least 3 m. high.

What is drainage? 
The drainage of an area consists of the different water resources that drain it. 
The drainage includes the rivers that flow over the region and the other water 
resources, including lakes and swamps. How rivers drain a certain area can be 
depicted by using contour maps. It is also possible to show the catchment areas 
and drainage basins of rivers as well as their general characteristics on contour 
maps. Hence, map readers and map users can acquire adequate information about 
the drainage of a certain place from contour maps.
Brainstorming
1 What is a watershed? What about a catchment area and a drainage pattern?
2 What is a river capture?
3 What are the stages of river valley development?
4 How are the different drainage features represented on contour maps?
2.2.1 Watershed and Catchment Area
The rivers that drain a certain geographical area flow over the region and form 
a certain pattern that is termed drainage pattern. A drainage pattern refers to the 
Grade 11 Geography 58
2.2 Drainage On Maps
general arrangement of a river and its tributaries within their drainage basin/
catchment area. A drainage basin/catchment area refers to the entire geographical 
space that is drained by the major river and its tributaries. For example, the whole 
area that is drained by the Abay River and all its tributaries forms the Abay River 
Basin in Ethiopia. A number of river basins together form the drainage system 
of a certain place. A drainage system is a system that is made up of all the river 
basins that flow in the same direction. For instance, all the rivers that flow in 
the western direction from the central highlands of Ethiopian form the Western 
Ethiopia Drainage System, which is also called the Mediterranean Sea Drainage 
System, based on their destination. 
Adjacent drainage basins are separated from one another by watersheds. A 
watershed/divide is higher ground which serves as a source region for streams 
and rivers that flow in different directions within their own distinct basins. Along 
the sides of a watershed, rivers flow into different drainage basins. That is why we 
say that a watershed is a dividing line between neighboring drainage basins. The 
patterns of most drainage basins evolve over a long period of time and usually 
become adjusted to the structure of the basin. 
Figure 2.37 shows you what the features that we have been discussing above look 
like in a certain geographical region.
A drainage basin and its watershed can be identified on a contour map. This can 
be done by observing the patterns and shapes of the contour lines that are used to 
represent the topography of the mapped area. To further simplify the process, it 
is good to investigate the flow direction of the streams and rivers that originate 
from the higher ground. The following steps can help you identify a drainage

F Identify the course of the main river on the map;
F Identify the tributaries of the main river on the map;
F Look at the contour lines near the origin of the tributaries and find high 
points and ridges;
F Look at other rivers that originate nearby and check whether they flow 
away from the main river;
F Once you identify the rivers that flow away from the main river, follow 
the way between those rivers that flow towards our main river and away 
from it. Then mark these points with solid or broken lines to show the 
river basin and its watershed.
While inserting a watershed on contour maps we should be very careful. The 
most important considerations follow. 
i A watershed (divide) is not drawn parallel between streams; rather 
the streams flow away from the watershed in opposite directions (see 
Figure 2.38).
ii Look at the streams’ direction of flow carefully. A watershed may 
wind but it never crosses the channel of a river, 
iii A watershed usually passes through the highest points between 
adjacent river basins. 
iv A watershed runs in the middle of two contour lines of different 
altitude. In the case of a river capture, however, a river can cross its 
watershed. 
Let us now try to identify the 
drainage basin and watershed of 
the river that is labeled “River A” 
in the following figure. Study how 
we follow the procedure described 
above as we identify the river’s 
basin and its divide. The red circle 
shows you where the river is located

2.2 Drainage On Maps 2.2 Drainage On Maps
A river’s catchment area includes all the geographic space that is drained by a 
major river and many other small streams that feed the major river with water. 
The major river in a river basin is the longest of all the rivers in the basin. The 
other small streams that supply water to the main rivers are called tributaries. 
The point at which the tributaries meet with the major river is called confluence. 
The point at which the major river in a basin starts is called the source of the 
river. Likewise, the point at which the river empties itself into an ocean, a sea or 
a lake is called the mouth of the river. Figure 2.39 shows you the points that we 
have discussed above. 
The labels on the map in Figure 2.39 represent the following features.
F Letter “A” represents the source of the main river; 
F Letter “B” represents the tributaries of the main river;

2.2.2 Drainage Patterns
What is a drainage pattern? How does it differ from a drainage basin? 
The rivers in each drainage basin form different patterns. A drainage pattern 
shows the characteristic way tributaries that feed other larger streams and rivers 
branch off in different directions. In other words, it could be understood as a 
pattern that is formed by the main river and its tributaries as they flow over the 
surface of the earth. Drainage patterns can have many different forms. They are 
based largely on the geological structure of the rocks on which they form. As 
topography varies, so does the drainage pattern. In addition, the types of rocks 
over which the river flows and the geological history of the region may also 
influence the drainage patterns of rivers.
Brainstorming
1 How many drainage patterns do you know? 
2 How do you distinguish one from the other?
There are a number of drainage patterns that rivers form in their basins. However, 
the most common ones are the following.
F Dendritic drainage pattern
F Trellis drainage pattern
F Radial drainage pattern
F Centripetal drainage pattern
F Rectangular drainage pattern
The features of the five drainage patterns are presented in the following 
descriptions and diagrams.
1 Dendritic Drainage Pattern: The term 
dendritic is derived from the Greek word 
“dendron” which literally means “a tree”. 
This drainage pattern is characterized by a 
tree-like shape with branches. The smallest 
tributaries are the outermost twigs, and 
the main river channel forms the trunk. 
The lower-order streams (tributaries) join 
the main (higher-order) streams at acute 
angles (less than 90o
 angles), forming 
Consequent stream

2.2 Drainage On Maps 2.2 Drainage On Maps
Y-shaped junctions. Dendritic patterns are usually formed in areas of 
homogeneous rock which comprises horizontal strata rock masses. In this 
drainage pattern, geological processes such as folding or faulting do not 
create structures that would affect the development of the river system. It is 
the most common drainage pattern of all the patterns.
F In sequent stream – these are tributaries that flow towards the main 
valley joining the main river (consequent stream) obliquely and in turn 
minor tributaries join them and the points where they flow into the main 
streams are accordant functions. 
F Oblique tributaries – these are minor tributary streams having a sloping 
direction, that join the in sequent stream obliquely. 
2 Trellis Drainage Pattern: Trellis drainage patterns develop in areas where 
harder and softer rocks alternate. The pattern of this drainage pattern is 
greatly affected by tectonic forces (folding and faulting). The branches 
of the river system usually join one another at nearly right angles. The 
branches are given different names, depending on their origin and direction 
of flow. These are:
i First-order streams (obsequent): are the tributaries of the subsequent 
streams that flow in the opposite direction to the consequent stream 
(main).
ii The consequent stream: the principal river which flows down the 
slope is called a consequent river.
iii The subsequent streams: are the tributaries which cut out valleys and 
which do not flow down the main slope. 
iv Secondary consequent streams (resequent): are the tributaries of the 
subsequent streams that flow in the same direction to the consequent 
stream.

3 Radial Drainage Pattern: Radial drainage patterns occur where rivers 
flow in all directions away from a raised feature. The raised feature may 
be a volcano or a mass of rock that is more resistant to erosion than the 
surrounding rock and therefore stands higher than its surrounding.
4 Centripetal Drainage Pattern:
Centripetal drainage patterns are 
found in areas where rivers flow 
from surrounding high ground 
toward a central basin, which is 
often occupied by a lake. The rivers 
flow into one common centre. 
5 Rectangular Drainage Pattern:
Rectangular drainage patterns 
usually form in areas that have 
numerous cracks that form a grid 
pattern. This pattern is common over 
certain types of rock, such as granite, 
in which cracks called joints develop 
to form a grid. Stream channels tend 
to follow these joint systems.

2.2.3 River Capture and Stage of River 
Valley Development
A River Capture
Brainstorming
1 What is a river capture?
2 How does a river capture form?
In a river capture situation, a river joins another river down-slope from a watershed 
that separates the two basins. In a river capture, a river of one basin will run over 
the drainage basin of another river. The river that flows over the basin of the other 
river is called the pirate stream, and the other river, whose basin is overrun by the 
pirate stream, is known as the victim stream. 
There are certain situations that cause the formation of river captures. The 
conditions include the following. When: 
F the rock on the side of the victim river is softer.
F heavy rainfall falls on the pirate’s river side of the watershed.
F the pirate river has a steeper course and erodes its course as a result.
F the watershed consists of very low ground and the watershed itself 
becomes indefinite.
Five different kinds of drainage patterns are formed by streams. These 
are dendritic, rectangular, radial, centripetal and trellis. Drainage patterns 
result from the type of soil in the area of drainage and the erosion of 
the soil by flowing water. Dendritic patterns usually form in areas of flat 
sedimentary rock, while areas with high central peaks, such as volcanoes, 
exhibit radial drainage patterns. Sometimes, water flows into a bowlshaped valley by centripetal drainage and creates a lake or erodes areas 
between ridges to create deep valleys, as seen in trellis drainage.
Grade 11 Geography 66
2.2 Drainage On Maps
Focus 
In a river capture, the following features are commonly observed.
i Elbow of capture: is a point where one strong river cuts into the 
course of another weak river during river capture.
ii Misfit or underfit stream: is a stream which is deprived of its 
headwaters and becomes too small for the valley it belongs to.
iii Reverse drainage: occurs when a river which was part of the 
original captured river C2
 now flows into C1
 in the opposite to that 
of direction the original direction of flow.
iv Wind gap: is found at the elbow of capture which was once 
covered by the captured stream but now contains no rivers and 
therefore becomes a “wind gap”.
Typical examples of river capture in Africa include: 
1 Tival River Capture (Kenya): In Kenya; the lower Tiva River has 
captured a former tributary of the Galona. 
2 Cunene River Capture (Angola): The upper Cunene River used 
to flow out from the Bihe plateau to a large inland drainage basin, 
similar to the Okavango Delta, but it was captured by a vigorous 
coastal steam and now turns west to the Atlantic.

B Stages of River valley Development
Brainstorming
1 What is a river valley? How does a river valley develop?
2 How many stages does a river have from its source up to its mouth?
The volume and gradient of a river are the two determinant factors of the force of 
a river before it reaches its base level. Base level is the surface of a river or lake 
or the sea into which a river flows. All rivers have their own sources and mouths. 
The source of a river can be a spring, a lake or a marsh, but it is generally in a 
higher ground where: 
F precipitation is high and there are other sources of water for the river; 
and
F there is a slope down which the run-off can flow.
The higher ground serves as the source region of the river or as the point at which 
the course of the river starts. From there, the river flows down-slope and passes 
Immediately after the formation of a river capture, there might be a connection 
across the newly formed watershed. This connection is known as a bifurcation, 
which means a stream divided into two.
Grade 11 Geography 68
2.2 Drainage On Maps
through different courses until it reaches its mouth. Along its entire course, from 
its headwaters at the top of the watershed to its mouth, a river has three distinct 
parts. These are: 
A the upper or mountain course;
B the middle or valley course; and
C the lower or plain course.
A The Upper Course
What are the characteristics of a river at its upper course? 
The upper course of a river is the headwater zone in the mountains or hills where 
sediment is supplied from hillsides and transported down steep channels with 
narrow flood plains. In these narrow, steep canyons, the bed of the river may be 
covered with large boulders as the river passes through many rapids. 
The following are the characteristics of a river at its youth stage:
F The development of deep narrow valley with V-shapes;
F The development of valleys with narrow and steep gradients;
F The presence of fast-flowing rivers;
F The development of pot-holes;
F The formation of interlocking spurs; and
F The presence of waterfalls, rapids and cataracts.
B The Middle Course
What are the major features of a river at its middle course? 
The middle course of a river forms when the mountains give way to the plains, 
where the steepness of the river channel decreases from as high as a 1-to-10 
percent to less than 0.1 percent. At this stage, the volume of the river may 
increase. However, the ability of the river to carve into rock and carry sediment 
decreases, due to the fact that the river’s channel has become less steep. As the 
speed of the river decreases, its power to carry and transport large-sized sediment 
also decreases. As a result, the sediment in the river gradually decreases in size 
from boulders (larger than 256 mm in diameter) to cobbles (between 64 and 
Unit 2: Map reading and Interpretation 69
2.2 Drainage On Maps 2.2 Drainage On Maps
256 mm) and to gravel (between 2 and 64 mm). As the gradient of the valley 
continues to decrease, the sediment becomes very fine, consisting mostly of sand, 
silt, and clay. At this stage, the floodplain of the river widens. 
At this stage, the river is characterized by the following features.
F the river flows over a relatively gentle gradient as compared to its upper 
course, and the river flows slowly as a result;
F the river’s volume increases gradually as it is joined by the tributaries 
that feed water to the river;
F the river’s valley gets wider and deeper. The slope along the valley’s 
sides gets gentler, altering the valley’s shape from a V-shape nearly to 
a U-shape, and
F braided streams may develop if large sheets of material are deposited 
on the level plain, splitting the river into several channels.
C The Lower Course
Discuss the major features of the lower course. 
The lower course of a river is the third stage in a river valley’s development. It 
is the course that is influenced by the ocean or lake where the river ends. The 
steepness of the river channel in this course is usually less than 10 centimeters 
per kilometer. Because the river flows very slowly, the sediment transported 
becomes very fine. At this stage, a delta may develop if enough sediment settles 
out of the water. Unlike a floodplain, a delta is a feature where the river splits 
into many new channels called distributaries while discharging into an ocean, 
a sea or a lake where it ends. If not enough sediment settles out to form a delta, 
the river may discharge into the sea in an estuary. Unlike a delta, an estuary is a 
wide channel where the fresh water from the river mixes with the salty seawater 
without forming distributaries.
At this stage, a river may have the following characteristics.
F The river flows in a U-shaped valley with a flat river bed, the rate of 
change in slope is minimal, and the river flows very slowly as a result;
F The river carries a heavy load of fine sediment of which some is 
deposited on its bed;
F The river flows with a number of twists and bends, resulting in the 
occurrence of meandering;
Grade 11 Geography 70
2.2 Drainage On Maps
F The development of oxbow lakes as meanders gradually develop cutoffs;
F The development of floodplains rich in alluvial deposits as fine sediment 
is accumulated on the river bed; and
F The river’s mouth may sometimes be blocked by sediments causing the 
river to branch out forming distributaries. In such a case, a delta may 
develop. If the river empties into its end freely with no distributaries 
formed, an estuary will develop.

The meanings of the features shown in Figure 2.46 are explained below. Study 
them carefully.
Source: The source of a stream is the point at which it begins.
Tributary: A tributary is a small stream or river that flows into a larger stream or 
river.
Confluence: A confluence is the point where a river and its tributary or a river 
and a glacier flow together. The word confluence can also mean the place where 
two or more streams merge into one.
Levee: A levee is a ridge of sediment on either side of a river channel. This 
sediment is gradually deposited as the river periodically floods and overflows its 
banks. 
Estuary: An estuary is the area in which the mouth of a river meets the ocean. 
Delta: A delta is a triangular deposit of soil or silt at the mouth of a river. In 
deltas, rivers split into multiple channels called distributaries. There are three 
types of deltas. They are based on the deltas’ shapes.
F Arcuate delta: This kind of delta has a convex outward margin. It is 
formed when the river empties into the sea. It is composed of coarse 
sediments like gravel and sand.
F Bird’s foot delta: This kind of delta projects irregularly into the sea. 
The river channel derides into a few distributaries. This is the only type 
of delta which maintains clearly defined channels.
F Cuspate delta: It is formed when a river joins its mouth (sea) on a 
straight coastline along which there is a strong current or tide so that 
the sedimentation takes place on either side of the river mouth.

2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps
Mouth: The mouth of a river is the area in which the river enters a larger body of 
water. The mouth of a canyon is where the canyon empties onto a plain.
Channel: A channel is the deepest part of a river and often has been used for 
navigational purposes. 
Oxbow lake: An oxbow lake is a loop of an old river meander that has been 
completely cut off from the river because of a shift in the river’s course.
Meander: A meander is a bend in a river created by the normal action of a mature 
stream as it winds across its floodplain. The river deposits sediment on the inner 
curve of the meander, where the current is the slowest. On the outer curve, where 
the current is strongest, the river banks erode. Eventually, the meander may 
develop into such a long loop that the river cuts across it to follow a shorter 
course, leaving behind an oxbow lake.

Discuss the following questions with your friend and try to come up with some ideas.
1 What is a settlement?
2 How is a settlement formed?
3 What sorts of factors determine the establishment of a settlement?
A settlement is a place where people live close together. It is a unit or organized 
group of people inhabiting a certain geographical area and making a living out 
of their surrounding environment. A settlement can also be defined as a group 
of buildings (houses) in specified area with people living in them. Settlements 
differ in their size, complexity and stage of development. While some settlements 
are extremely large with diversified socio-economic conditions, others are very 
small and less diversified. Settlements range from a little collection of single 
buildings to megalopolises. As a result, we can have different hierarchies of 
settlements. Figure 2.48 shows you the different types of settlements based on 
their population size and diversity of services.

Hamlets
Villages
Towns
Cities
Large City
Metropolis
Conurbation
Megalopolis

When we move up wards from 
isolated buildings to megalopolis, population increases 
and services get diversiied. On 
the other hand, frequency of 
occurence increases down the 
pyramid.

2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps
In Figure 2.48 ,above isolated dwellings with a few people living in them is 
represented by the lowest level of the pyramid, and the megalopolis, which has 
the greatest number of people, is at the top. As we move from the bottom to 
the top of the pyramid, we observe changes in population size and in service 
delivery, quality and diversity. In terms of frequency, smaller settlements are the 
most frequently developed settlements in the world. The meaning of each of the 
types of settlement in the above diagram is given below.
Settlements can be urban or rural. Urban settlements are developed in areas with 
non-agricultural economic activities. In contrast, rural settlements develop in areas 
where agriculture forms the base of the economy. Smaller settlements are usually 
in rural areas, and larger settlements are associated with urban environments. The 
location, size, shape, function and pattern of settlements can be shown on maps. 
Cartographers use different kinds of signs and symbols to represent settlements 
on maps. The discussion below gives you some idea about how settlements are 
represented on topographic maps. 
2.3.1 Representation of Settlements on 
Maps
How do human beings establish their settlements? How do we represents 
settlement on maps? What factors determine the patterns of settlement? 
Megalopolis: a group of conurbations, with each having more than ten 
million people. 
Conurbation: a group of large cities and their suburbs, with three to ten 
million people. 
Metropolis: a large city and its suburbs, consisting of multiple cities and towns 
with one to three million people. 
Large city: a city with a large population and many services with a population 
of between 300,000 and 1 million. 
City: a city has abundant services, but not as many as a large city. A city has a 
population of between 100,000 and 300,000. 
Large town: a large town has a population of 20,000 to 100,000. 
Town: a town has a population of 1,000 to 20,000. 
Village: a village generally does not have many services, possibly only a small 
corner shop or post office. A village has a population of 100 to 1,000. 
Hamlet: a hamlet has a tiny population, usually less than 100, and very few or 
no services, and few buildings. 
Isolated dwelling: an isolated dwelling would only have 1 or 2 buildings or 
families in it. It would have negligible services, if any.

2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps 2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps
Maps are important tools for showing settlements. In different ways, maps depict 
the shapes settlements have, different features that are found in the settlements, 
the patterns of settlements and their functions. To represent settlements and their 
features, cartographers use different techniques including colors and different 
signs and symbols. 
I Signs and Symbols Used on Settlement Maps
Most topographic maps contain abundant information about human-made 
features. One of these features is human settlement. A number of different 
features, such as residential areas, schools, hospitals, mining sites, industries, 
communication and transportation features, and the like, are found in settlements. 
Cartographers use different techniques to show these features on their maps. One 
of these techniques is using various types of signs and symbols to show features 
that are found in the settlements represented. The common signs and symbols 
used for showing settlement features are given in Table 2.2.

Unit 2: Map reading and Interpretation 77
2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps 2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps
Settlements have different shapes that result from many factors. Some of these 
factors are the site and situation of the settlement. The term Site means where 
the settlement has been developed. On the other hand, Situation refers to the 
“where” of the settlement in relation to the surrounding area. Situation can 
also be described as the “where about” of a settlement. The site and situation 
of a settlement is the most important determinant factor of its shape. Basically, 
settlements are classified into three major groups based on their shapes. These 
are: 
Â Dispersed settlement 
Â Nucleated settlement
Â Linear settlement
a Dispersed settlements: These are settlements established by one family 
or a few family residences scattered about in isolated places. They are 
separated from one another by physical barriers. Life in this kind of 
settlement is simple, quiet, and much the same all the year round. There is 
little opportunity for social gatherings. Dispersed settlements are typically 
found in the tropical rainforests and scrub lands in Africa and Australia. 
Dispersed settlements are mostly found in rural areas.
b Nucleated settlements: These are groupings of several family residences 
such as hamlets, villages and small periodic-market towns. Such settlements 
are usually developed around a certain central point. In such a settlement, 
there are collective amenities to serve the community like shops, houses, 
schools, places of worship, entertainment and transport networks. The 
pattern of the settlement is compact, concentrated and can be distinguished 
by certain well-developed features. Ethiopian examples of nucleated 
settlements are Addis Ababa, Bahir Dar, Harar, Gondar, Bishoftu etc.
c Linear (Ribbon) Settlements: A linear settlement is a kind of settlement 
which has an elongated pattern. This type of pattern is usually a roadoriented settlement pattern. Most of the towns that are found along the 
main highway lines from Addis Ababa to Gondar, Mekele, Asosa, Harar, 
and Jimma are good examples of linear settlement in Ethiopia. Some linear 
settlements are situated on an elongated relief feature such as a ridge. The 
town of Ghimbi in Welega is a good example of a settlement that develops 
along a ridge.

2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps
III Types of Settlements
How many types of settlements are there? How do you differentiate urban 
settlement from rural settlement? What are the major economic activities in 
rural areas? 
Based on where settlements are developed, they can be grouped into two types as 
Rural settlement and Urban settlement. Rural settlements are those that develop 
in agricultural areas. In contrast, urban settlements are those that develop in 
non-agricultural areas where the major economic activities are non-agricultural. 
Each of the two types of settlements has its own features. For instance, rural 
settlements have very low levels of socio-economic infrastructure and are poorly 
interconnected. Services are limited. Their economy is primarily agricultural. 
Rural settlements have very low divisions of labor. They are also sparsely 
populated. Contrary to this, urban settlements are characterized by non-agricultural 
activities such as different businesses, service-giving sectors, industries and the 
like. They also have a high division of labor. Infrastructures, such as transport 
and communication facilities, schools, and hospitals, and modern houses, etc. 
are well-developed. Urban settlements are densely populated as people live very 
close to each other. 
Rural and urban settlements can easily be distinguished based on the features that 
each manifests. The characteristic features that can help the easy differentiation 
of urban (town, city) settlements from rural settlements on topographic maps 
include the following.

Urban Rural
F has groups of buildings on vast 
built-up areas;
F has planned streets;
F has defined shapes of settlement.
F has houses made out of simple 
materials (wood and mud); 
F has no planned streets;
F has narrow and irregular roads;
F has no defined shape;
F covers a small area. 
IV Factors Influencing the Location of Settlement Sites
What factors influence, the location of settlements? How do they affect the 
locations of settlement sites?
The site of a settlement is where it has been built. Settlements develop when 
people settle in a certain area. Their settling in an environment to form a permanent 
settlement is the result of a number of factors influencing the settlers. There are a 
number of factors that were important to the original settlers.
When we carefully observe the location of towns and cities, we can see that their 
sites and situations have various advantages that have helped them to grow there. 
This is related to the factors that caused the development of the settlements. For 
instance, Addis Ababa is sited at the foothills of the Entoto Mountains where the 
hot springs of the present day filuwuha are situated. Its position is its location in 
relation to the rest of the region. Similarly, the town of Bahir Dar is situated to the 
southwest of Lake Tana and northwest of the Tis Esat fall. 
The choice of a settlement site is affected by many factors. The following are 
some of the more favorable combinations of site and situation which have led to 
the establishment of settlements.
F Fertile alluvial plain: the primary and basic necessities of humanbeings 
are food and water. A fertile alluvial plain drained by rivers is ideal 
for raising food crops and maintaining a potable water supply. A flat 
landscape facilitates the movement of people and goods. It is an ideal 
situation for the exchange of products and ideas. It is the potential center 
for trade communication and administration. Examples are Hawasa on 
the rich Lake Hawasa plain, Wereta in the intensively cultivated Fogera 
basin drained by the Rib and Gumara Rivers.
Grade 11 Geography 80
2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps
F Coastal lowlands: where narrow coastal plains are bounded on the 
landward side by mountains, agriculture, transport and settlement all 
have to be carried out on the lower land. Where there is a mountain 
barrier, this naturally leads to the growth of a town. 
F Water supply: water is one of the most important natural resources to 
human beings. Therefore, at any cost, the site of a settlement should 
be near a good water supply. Springs, streams, and storage dams 
should be remote from flooding and water germs. Such settlement sites 
include ports, confluences, bridge points, and spring lines at the base 
of escarpment river banks. For example, Khartoum is a confluence city 
and Djibouti is a port town.
Focus
Water (wet-point) sites are ideal for a settlement for a number of reasons 
like pure and adequate potable water, fishing, irrigation, power generation 
(HEP) and communication. 
F A natural focus of routes: These are the nodal towns. By the very 
nature of their geographical location, many towns assume importance 
as centers of road, rail or water communication. People tend to provide 
commercial and social services that passing travelers can make use of. 
An example of such nodal town in Ethiopia is Kombolcha.
F Sites for Generating hydro–electric power: waterfalls are of paramount 
importance for generating hydro–electricity. Where such a site occurs, 
the availability of cheap power attracts industrial establishments. These 
require labor and other services and a settlement is very likely to grow 
up taking advantage of the cheap power. Examples of such settlements 
include Buffalo to the south of the Niagara Falls in the US, and Bahir 
Dar and Fincha in Ethiopia.
F Defensive Sites: a defensive site is a place that is difficult to attack. 
This was a deciding factor in the 19th century in Ethiopia when 
defensive strategy that was executed at the right moment could save 
the whole community. However, in modern warfare with aerial attacks 
the community could not be saved. Some settlements were chosen due 
Unit 2: Map reading and Interpretation 81
2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps 2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps
to their physical protection for a given tribal group against another 
tribal enemy. Some towns in Ethiopia were established on a hilltop or 
hillsides for defense and patrolling purposes. For instance, the Yirgalem, 
Chencha (Gamo–Gofa), Asela, etc. villages on the Bouci plateaus were 
established in isolated spots at the bases of rocky ridges and covered by 
dense forest. Government policies in the hidden areas of modern Africa 
have established nucleated defensive settlements.
F Communications: Communication networks are important factors in 
settlement sites. This becomes evident if the settlement produces cash 
crops for market. Proximity to transportation networks eases movement 
for speedy marketing of agricultural products. Large villages grow into 
large towns if they are situated at road junctions. Good examples of this 
case in Ethiopia are Mojo, Awash, Shashmene, Wereta, and Woldya. 
F Mineral wealth: The discovery of minerals and their extraction can be 
a facilitating factor for the development of settlements. Anywhere on 
earth, be it on mountain tops or arid (desert) areas, valuable minerals 
attract investors and investment to work in the mines. Such conditions 
create favorable opportunities for settlements to develop. For example, 
Johannesburg’s growth in the Republic of South Africa has been 
accelerated by the discovery of gold in the Witwatersrand. It is now the 
second largest city in Africa next to Cairo.
V Function of Settlement
Settlements, by their very nature perform certain useful functions to ascertain 
their continued existence, most of them have several functions. A village or a 
town may serve the community as a meeting place for people and goods and 
have no other functions to distinguish it from other villages. A village grows 
in to a town and later in to a city, the increase in population alone insures 
many activities that a village does not require. Towns may comprise several 
functions. However, most towns have one dominant function. Maps can give 
us some sort of information regarding the land use (economic importance) of 
settlements. There is a possibility to know the function of a town by just looking 
the situation and the name on topographic maps. For example, beach side holy 
day resorts, Commercial ports, mining centers, etc. We can therefore, classify 
towns according to their functions.
1 Market towns: These are towns whose major function is as centre of 
exchange of goods and service. They are distribution centres for local 
Grade 11 Geography 82
2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps
products, for example, Nedjo (Welega), Kola Diba (N. Gondar), Ginchi 
(near Ambo), Agaro (in Jimma), Tepi (in Kaffa), Durbete ( west Gojam), 
etc. Kumasi (Ghana). 
2 Industrial towns: Towns of these kinds are engaged in processing raw 
materials into finished goods. These towns have some advantages as 
industrial sites such as:
F Proximity to power,
F Minerals,
F Raw materials, labor or markets,
F Are served by modern net work of communication. 
Example: 
Akaki, Dukam, Adama, Dire Dawa, Bahir Dar, Gondar, Mekele, Hawasa, etc. 
3 Commercial towns: The major function of these types of towns is just 
serving as centers of commerce and finance, where trade is the primary 
concern. There are financial institutions such as banking, insurance 
and other financial sectors. London is the financial head quarters of the 
common wealth. New York is the financial centre of USA, Addis Ababa is 
the financial centre of Ethiopia.
4 Mining towns: mining oriented towns may be located in very unusual 
places , but adequate mineral resources. Some towns shrink and become 
ghost towns due to the exhaustion of minerals. Many acquire other functions 
and are permanent towns. Mining centers can be located on maps by quarry 
symbols. This includes rocks (building stone, limestone and gravel for 
road construction). Gravel pits heavy machinery, water and power supply, 
smelteries , roasting, oil roads, railways and pipelines are indicators of 
mining villages.
5 Holiday resorts, hill and health resorts: These towns with various kinds 
of resorts are located in favorable geographical surroundings. They include 
coastal resorts for batting and yatching. For example, Mombasa (Kenya), 
port Sudan (Sudan), Pretoria (south Africa).
Hill resorts for mountain climbing and for the cool mountain air. For 
example, Semien mountain( Ras Dejen). Health resorts for those whole 
need specialists treatment. For example, Soderie (Oromia), Wondo Ghent 
(Oromya), Wanzaye (south Gondar).
Unit 2: Map reading and Interpretation 83
2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps 2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps
6 Forestry (Lumbering): Forestry oriented towns are classified according 
to their latitudinal location and forest type these are deciduous, coniferous 
tropical and mixed wood land. They are depicted on maps by pictorial 
(tree) symbols 
7 Administrative towns: these types of towns are the head quarters of the 
government and they are capital cities or centres of local administration. 
They deal with the administration and organization of the nation. Some 
are continental capitals (Addis Ababa) and international capitals (Geneva, 
New York)
8 Cultural and educational towns: These are towns in which are found 
world renowned universities. For example, Oxford and Cambridge in 
England and Laiden in the Netherlands:
9 Ecclesiastical cities: towns under this category are very exceptional. 
Towns of this type are perform special functions such as historical and 
religious centers and are frequently visited by pilgrims from all corners of 
the world. These include Jerusalem (Judaism, Christianity), Mecca (Islam), 
Varanasi (Hinduism) other smaller ones include religious associations for 
example, Vatican, Lalibela, Axum and Kulubi (Orthodox Christianity), 
Nejash (Islam) in Ethiopia.

2.3.2 The Study of Communication on Maps 
Transport Network 
What is a transport network? What are those factors that affect transport 
networks?
Communication feature can be shown on topographic maps by using different 
signs and symbols. It is also possible to measure distance from one point to 
another. Gradients of various transport networks can be also calculated and viable 
Grade 11 Geography 84
2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps
types of vehicles for them can be identified based on slope gradients.
Recognizing communication features on maps:
F Marginal information on maps is the most important tool for map 
readers who are reading those communication features on topographical 
maps. These include foot paths, tracks, roads, railway lines airways, 
waterways etc. Those features can be distinguished from their names 
and conventional signs and symbols depicted on the map.
a Foot paths (Trails): These are usually found in the open countryside 
and in hills or mountains where construction of metalled road surfaces is 
impossible or extremely expensive. These are commonly found in rural 
Africa, and most of the people are served by trails and tracks.
b Roads: Roads ranging from mule tracks to modern highways are the most 
universal form of transport. Roads are classified by their width and surface 
quality: Topographic maps show various classes of roads by using different 
symbols. Some of them are: tarmac (asphalt) roads or first-class roads 
(highways), metallic (graded surfaced) roads, and cart tracks (dry-weather 
roads).
c Railways: compared with road transport, rail travel avoids congestion 
causes less pollution, is cheaper and quicker over relatively long distances, 
and is safer and more comfortable. 
Railway lines can be distinguished on topographic maps by symbols. 
Such a map also shows railway lines with single and multiple tracks, 
small-gauge and mineral working lines and all the constructional detail is 
given alongside the track. Therefore, a railway line is controlled by relief. 
Railway lines find river gaps and passes and maintain a level course by 
cutting bridges, via ducts and embankments. 
Figure 2.50: A railway with a bridge, cutting and embankments
Unit 2: Map reading and Interpretation 85
2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps 2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps
d Cart tracks: most of the cart tracks shown on topographic map are, at least 
in the dry season, used by four-wheel drive vehicles. 
e Waterways (Navigation): waterways are divided into two major groups: 
F Inland waterways. F Sea routes. 
The inland waterways include navigable rivers, canals and coastal shipping 
routes. They can be identified on maps by the presence of sea ports in 
association with structures like jetties, lighthouses, harbor offices and 
break waters. Rivers are also important to convey goods and passengers 
from the coast to the inland. The location of ports near a river mouth and 
the occurrence of locks following paths, piers for unloading, straightened 
courses, and dense building along the bank of the river show that the river 
is navigable. 
Canals are easily recognized on a map. They are depicted on topo maps as 
long straight sections along the contours, moving from one level to another 
with the help of locks. 
f Other means of communication: These include communications, radio/
TV stations and microwave and tower stations which are shown by their 
own symbols and names. 
Factors Affecting the Development of Transport Network 
What are the factors that affect the development of transport net work? 
The major factor that affects the development of a transport network is the need 
for transport. Transport facilities are prime necessity for two purposes: 
F to serve economic activities
F to make strategic control of a country possible. 
Figure 2.51: A via duct: The road bridge across low lying dry land
Grade 11 Geography 86
2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps
These purposes can be coordinated when the transport network of a given country 
is planned. Economic development is unthinkable without the development of 
transport networks.
It is obvious that roads and railways can be constructed in any place where they 
are needed. However, the actual course followed and the pattern of the resulting 
network is influenced by the natural environment through which the roads and 
railways have to pass. The two important elements to be considered by road 
planners are relief and natural water courses. 
i Relief: One of the major obstacles for transport development is relief 
(terrain). Due to these large changes in altitude, roads make use of serpentine 
bends and tunnels or they pass around the mountains or over them. 
ii Water shed road route: sometimes road routes follow watersheds just 
to avoid crossing numerous rivers which require expensive bridges. For 
example the Addis Ababa-Mekele road via Dessie follows the watershed 
between the Abbay Basin on one side and the Awash Basin draining towards 
Djibouti. 
iii River valley roads route: river valleys are preferred under certain 
conditions. Usually the gradients of river valleys have been smoothed by 
erosive action of rivers. This makes road construction easier and less costly.
iv Water bodies: These are another hurdle to road and rail construction. Rivers 
can be crossed either by bridges or ferries. Swamps and marshy areas are 
negotiated by road and rail engineers. If there is no choice, they are crossed 
by viaducts or long continuous embankments. 
g Air Transport
What advantage does air transport have over the others? 
Air transport is a recent mode of transport. This new form of transport has great 
advantages, because it is affected very little by different land forms or ground 
conditions. An airplane can cross mountains, dense forests and large oceans with 
the greatest ease and speed. It can reach the remotest, the farthest and the most 
inaccessible places on earth, provided a landing place is available. Air fields, 
due to their long runways and the undesirable associated noise and danger, are 
constructed a somewhat distant from densely populated and heavily built-up 
areas. 
Unit 2: Map reading and Interpretation 87
2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps 2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps
Airfields, where airplanes land and take off, are the only physical evidences of 
air transport in the landscape. These points are known as aerodromes, airports, 
landing strips or heliports, depending on the facilities existing at these points. 
Aerodromes and airports are points where single or several tarmac runways 
equipped with navigational aids exist. The Addis Ababa international air field 
layout is a good example and it is the largest in Ethiopia, followed by those in 
Dire Dawa, Mekele, Bahir Dar, Gondar and Axum. 
The map on the preceding figure portrays a modern airport with the necessary 
equipment. The map shows the railway and the road connecting the airport with 
the land-transport network for taking passengers and goods from and to the 
airport. 
2.3.3 Climbing Capacities of Vehicles
Do you remember what you have learnt about gradient in the previous lessons? 
What is gradient? How do you explain gradient in relation to slope and altitude?
The surface of the earth is not uniform throughout. There are a number of ups 
and downs with slopes varying in degree. A particular surface landform may 
be concave, convex, uniform or irregular. But the slope, as opposed to the 
actual landform, will still be the same. Therefore, the slope is determined by the 
relationship between the end points of a line; the slope and the altitude between 
the two points. Ups and downs are expressed in terms of slope and gradient. 
When there are big differences in local relief, roads usually climb or descend along 
the rivers. Railways are very much more affected by relief than roads because of 
their low hill-climbing capacity. This is because railways require much smaller 
gradients than roads, 2 percent is given as the maximum for railways. This means 
that when a railway and a road have to travel the same ascent, the railway uses a 
different and much longer route than the road. 
Example: 
Two points, ‘A’, located at the foot of the eastern escarpment in Ethiopia at 
an altitude of 500 m, and ‘B’ located at 2500 m are to be joined with a road 
and a railway 
a what is the length of the road? 
b what is the length of the railway? 
Grade 11 Geography 88
2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps
Solution: 
Using the formula for calculating gradients, we get: 
 altitude difference = 2500 500
 = 
1000
− 2 kilometers 
Maximum gradient for cars = 25%
Ground distance (unknown) = x 
a the shortest possible distance for the road is: 
25 = Altitude
x

25 = 
2 100

×
x
8 km (the length of the road) 
b The shortest possible distance for the railway is: 
2 2
 = 100 = 100 km ×
x
 (the length of the railway) 
The solution applied in road construction, the building of roads in serpentines, 
cannot be applied to railways. 
Railways avoid drastic changes in altitude for two reasons: 
F requires high cost of construction
F the daily operation costs are high 
Generally railways avoid large changes in altitude, which involves the construction 
of tunnels, embankments, cutting, etc. 
The gradient of the slope is determined by the relationship between the vertical 
distance of two points and the horizontal distance between them. 
Focus 
Slope is a measure of the vertical difference in the altitude (elevation) of a 
surface at two different points. 
Unit 2: Map reading and Interpretation 89
2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps 2.3 The Study Of Human-made Features On Maps
As discussed in the previous lessons, railway lines and road transport networks 
are constructed in accordance with the maximum possible hill-climbing capacity 
of vehicles. This means the road should serve all vehicles ranging from fourwheel drive cars to ordinary bicycles. In doing so, we should not build them in a 
straight line up the slope. Instead a winding (bending) line or “serpentine” road.
This is done in order to reduce the steepness or gradient of the road. This 
reduction of gradient is necessary since different vehicles have different hillclimbing capacities. The following is a list of maximum gradients for different 
means of transport. 
Table 2.3: Maximum gradients for different means of transport
Means of transport Maximum Gradient
Train 2%
Ordinary cars 25%
4 wheel drive cars 30%
Man–walking up Without 
support of hands 45%
Bicycles 10% 
One should bear in mind that their numbers stand for ordinary trains, cars or 
bicycles. When one buys a car or bicycle, he should be informed about the 
specific hill-climbing capacity by the vehicle’s technical data. 
The highest road gradient in Ethiopia is the Limalimo road, (which is 12 percent 
gradient) which stretches from R.Tekeze to Debark, where we find numerous 
detours to minimize the gradient of the slope.

NOTE 
When you construct a road network, the following points should 
be taken in to consideration. 
F Every meter of road costs a lot of money to build and therefore, 
all unnecessary bends in the road should be avoided. 
F Avoid the construction of unnecessary bridges. 
F If your road follows a river, bank with the least number of 
tributaries should be chosen. If a major river has to be crossed, 
the crossing should be done in the upper course of the river 
where the width of the river is as narrow as possible. 
F Detours to avoid bridging should be reasonable.
F Avoid unnecessary changes in altitude. 
F When it is necessary to overcome large differences in altitude, 
as is the case very often in Ethiopia, the road should be made 
to follow a river valley. This is for the reason that river valleys 
naturally have lower gradients. When you cross a mountain 
range, you should look for the lowest possible section of that 
ridge which can be a pass or a col. 
F Avoid marshy ground. The construction of a road through 
marshy ground is very expensive, difficult and sometimes 
impossible. 
F Pass the road through existing towns and heavily crowded 
villages.

2.4.1 What is Geographic Information 
System (GIS)?
Students may give different answers for this question. The main reason for this 
is that GIS can be understood by different people differently. For some, GIS is a 
branch of information technology, for others it is a computer-assisted mapping 
and cartographic application, and for others it is a set of spatial-data analytical 
tools.
At this level we would like to define GIS as a system of hardware, software and 
procedures designed to support the capture, management, manipulation, analysis, 
modeling and display of spatially referenced data for solving complex spatial 
problems. 
Before understanding how the system works it is important for you to understand 
data, information and systems.
Data are a collection of raw facts representing places, things, people, events and 
concepts in the form of numbers, text, figures, symbols and signals. 
Grade 11 Geography 92
2.4 Geographical Information System (gis)
Information is data that have been transformed through processing such as 
structuring, formatting, conversion and modeling.
The word system can be used in different contexts. It can be used to describe 
physical entities or conceptual entities 
Physical entities
F Solar system
F Ecosystem
F Drainage system
F Immune system 
Conceptual entities 
F Political system
F Democratic system
F Computer system
F Economic system
In this context, GIS is a physical entity designed to achieve the specific objective 
of collecting, storing, analyzing and presenting information in systematic ways 
2.4.2 Turning Point on the development of 
GIS 
F The first GIS called the Canada Geographic Information System was 
built in the 1960s by the Canadian government to analyze data collected 
by the Canada Land Inventory. 
F Similar systems were built by other governments and university 
laboratories following the developments in Canada. 
F The increased accessibility of computers in the 1970s as a result of 
technological improvements and lower costs of computers heralded the 
beginning of wide application of GIS.
F In the 1980s GIS sales increased tremendously as governments and 
businesses found more uses of the systems. New GIS software began to 
be produced by a number of companies to program computer systems 
to increase their functions. 
F By the early 1990s, about 100,000 GIS systems were in operation.
F By now, GIS has come to be one of the most important systems in making 
spatial analysis and many other geographic researches.
Unit 2: Map reading and Interpretation 93

Uses of GIS
Some of the applications of GIS are stated as follows: 
F Urban planning: This is concerned with the development of master 
plans. The first step in an urban GIS is the production of improved 
property descriptions. The high quality database is immediately useful 
for many purposes. 
F GIS is used to monitor patterns of urban growth. This is done by 
overlaying urban area maps for two different times to produce a change 
map showing urban growth. Such information helps city planners for 
example, in planning schools. 
F GIS data can also be used in neighborhood planning applications –
for example, in a given city, it is possible to evaluate neighborhoods 
requesting funding to help increase owner occupancy of housing. 
Traffic Control 
GIS is used to regulate and monitor traffic flows in streets and overcrowded 
highways. Information is provided into GIS from video monitors, vehicle 
detectors, etc. When there is traffic congestion, the information is used as 
background for decisions about changes in message signs, lane signals and other 
controls. 
Emergency Management 
GIS and GPS (Geographic Positioning System) techniques are used by emergency 
management personnel before, during and after natural or human-made disasters. 
Some of the natural hazards that cause human and material damage are earth 
tremors, floods, fires, hurricanes, tornados, etc. In order to take quick action, 
there must be background information about the accessibility of the disaster area, 
including its utilities, highways, population, terrain and other elements of the 
environment. This information is stored in a GIS system. 
During an emergency, additional information is gathered and provided by GPS 
(Geographic Positioning System). In doing so, current maps of damage to roads, 
utilities and buildings can be produced. This information helps the emergency 
teams to plan alternate routes for emergency cars and other related tasks. The 
same information can be used after performing the emergency tasks. This includes 
the refinement of maps that are useful for assessing the number and degree of 
casualties and the value of damage. 
Grade 11 Geography 94
2.4 Geographical Information System (gis)
GIS also plays an important role for recording, monitoring, and coordinating 
reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts. Eventually, such information can be 
collected earlier and combined with high-risk parameters. This information 
includes physical features like steep slopes, vegetation cover, types of building 
construction and material and building density. 
This information is useful when transferring people from the disaster area and 
when generally reducing risks for the future. 
Airport Noise Management 
The degree of noise is mapped around airports using data concerning airport 
configurations accompanied by aircraft noise-generation monitoring. This 
information can be used to reduce noise impacts near the airports. This can be 
achieved by examining noise incidents and by planning future land use and 
airport designs to reduce exposure levels. 
Education 
GIS is used in schools of all levels. One junior high school, for example, carried 
out a project in which pupils formulated a regional GIS database. They handed 
over the results to show the school administration that the site of the newly 
constructed library building was vulnerable to being robbed. The quality of their 
report may have influenced the outcome of the project. 
Scientific Research 
GIS-conducted research can assess the quality of medicines that are imported 
from abroad to determine whether they fulfill international standards. The 
availability of this information will allow importers to map those countries that 
manufacture medicines below the international standard. 
Social Programs 
GIS methods are used to generate data on unemployment rate increases in relation 
to economic development in a given country. Such a study might be related to 
population growth rate. 
Unit 2: Map reading and Interpretation 95
2.4 Geographical Information System (gis) 2.4 Geographical Information System (gis)
Public Health 
GIS has been used to identify health problems caused by lack of sanitary practices. 
Such application-generated maps show the relationship between income and 
level of education and the number of people that lack sanitary practices. Areas 
where many households were exposed to different diseases due to lack of sanitary 
practices have been given priority for free medical treatment. 
Resource Management 
Resource management problems prevail in many regions. In one coffee growing 
region, GIS was used to map, analyze and manage a complex weather condition. 
This weather condition, frost, affects the field and greatly affects the local 
economy. 
Wildlife Management 
GIS is also used in wildlife management applications – for instance, the 
identification of favorable Mountain Nyala habitats in the Bale mountains. The 
approach involved a study to find the territories of existing Mountain Nyala packs 
by radio tracking. Characteristics of these territories were analyzed in a GIS. The 
information gained was then used to search for similar habitats throughout the 
region. These potential habitats were analyzed to evaluate their potential for the 
introduction and protection of new Mountain Nyala packs. 
Military Base Management 
GIS is important for military purposes, especially to protect base residents. It is 
also used to protect plants and animal habitats when missiles and other weapons 
are tested. Regarding environmental problems, GIS provides information on facts 
such as wetlands, flood zones, archaeological sites, resort areas, etc. 
GIS is also applicable to emergency cases such as chemical plumes, wildfires, 
etc. and for activities such as the selection of safe areas suitable for storage of 
explosives.
Agriculture 
GIS is used in the agricultural sector. This application is known as precision 
Grade 11 Geography 96
2.4 Geographical Information System (gis)
farming to increase agricultural production by reducing farm costs. The 
application depends on soil maps especially prepared by GIS technology. 
The map is prepared based on aerial photographs and on soil samples taken in 
each field. The soil samples are analyzed, and a soil map of the farm is prepared 
in a GIS system. Decisions are passed based on the analyzed data, regarding the 
allocation of the appropriate fertilizer and herbicide for each soil type. 
These requirements are mapped and put in another GIS file to be used in the field. 
The attached computer compares the location of the tractor with the product 
application map and continuously adjusts the mix and application rate of the 
fertilizer/herbicide. 
In previous times, fertilizers and herbicides were mixed and applied at an average 
rate over entire fields. This was an inappropriate application of fertilizer and 
herbicides. 
Precision farming enables the farmer to apply fertilizer and herbicides 
proportionally with respect to the required amount. This method is applied at low 
cost and reduces all sorts of erosion. 
 In the Field of Tourism
GIS provides information about services and facilities of tourist sites.

 UNIT SUMMARY 
Þ The height of the surface of the earth varies from place to place. 
Þ Land features such as plains, hills, mountains, valleys, etc. which make the 
earth’s surface uneven are known as relief features. 
Þ The accurate method of representing relief on maps is by means of contour 
lines. 
Þ A contour is an imaginary line drawn on a map. It joins all points having the 
same height above mean sea level. 
Þ Contour lines are drawn from pre-measure points called spot heights. The 
construction of contour lines becomes possible once the spot heights are 
plotted on the map. 
Þ The landforms shown on contour maps can also be made more clear 
and simple to understand by drawing cross-sections, profiles and block 
diagrams. 
Þ In the process of terrain study and analysis from a contour map, you have 
to describe the various kinds of landforms, the nature of slopes, gradients 
and intervisibility of different places. 
Þ Topographic maps also show drainage features and patterns such as 
river basins, catchment areas, watersheds and other land features that 
develop in different stages of streams. 
Þ The types and distribution of human settlements and communication 
features are shown on topomaps by using conventional signs and symbols. 
Þ You should keep in mind that the site of a settlement is not arbitrarily 
chosen. It has been chosen for a combination of several reasons. 
Þ Relief, water supply, health, defence, communications, government 
policies, and economic resources are some of the facts that influence the 
choice of site of settlement. 
Þ It is useful to learn to read and understand maps that show different 
communication features ranging from roads to airways. 
Þ The science of GIS is very important. The system of GIS (Geographical 
Information System) needs flexibility. 
The system should include capabilities for manipulating, comparing, or 
combining the data in different ways.
