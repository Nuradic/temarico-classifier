A Size
How large is Africa’s Population?
What percent of the world’s population is constituted by Africa’s population?
Africa has one of the world’s largest populations. The continent is the world’s 
second most populous next to Asia. According to the World Population Data 
sheet, by the mid of 2009, the continent had a total population of 999 million 
(nearly 1 billion). This makes up nearly 14.7 % of the world’s total population. 
As the table below depicts, Africa’s population is nearly 1/4th of that of Asia, the 
most populous, and 28 times that of Oceania, the least populous.

B Growth
What is population growth? What are the components of population change? 
How fast is Africa’s population growing?
Africa has one of the world’s fastest growing populations. The continent has 
been experiencing rapid changes in its population size as a result of many factors 
including the interactions between fertility and mortality. Despite the gradual 
decline in the birth and death rates, the continent continues to experience high rate 
of population growth. As some historical sources indicate, Africa’s population 
had been increasing very slowly until recent times. However, since the 1950, the 
continent’s population began to increase very rapidly. As a result, the continent’s 
population had almost been quadrupled between 1950 and 2000. The following

As it can clearly be seen from the above table, Africa’s population had been 
increasing very slowly until the early 1950s. The 1000 A.D. population of Africa 
had taken more than 650 years to double itself. Another nearly 300 years were 
passed until the 1650 population doubles again. Since the 1950’s the continent’s 
population began to grow faster and it took only about 25 years to double itself. 
Another population doubling has still been experienced in the last 25 years of the 
20th century between 1975 and 2000. Since 2000 till 2009, another 200 million 
people were added making Africa’s population nearly a billion.
The population growth rate of Africa is the fastest in the world. According to the 
2009 world population data sheet, the continent had a rate of natural increase of 
2.4%. The general growth rate, on the other hand, was 2.3%. This appears being

the highest rate in the world and twice as fast as the world’s average growth rate. 
In terms of the period that Africa’s population needs to double itself, the continent 
has the world’s shortest doubling time of about 29 years. Such a rapid population 
growth rate and short doubling time is the result of the very high fertility rate that 
the continent has. Although birth rate is declining in the continent, it is still high 
as compared to the rest of the world. The declining mortality in the continent is 
also the highest in the world. The difference between the two has produced a very 
high rate of population growth and short period of doubling time in Africa.

Rate of Natural Increase (RNI) is the difference between Birth Rate and 
Death Rate expressed in percentage. On the other hand, General Growth 
Rate is the difference between RNI and Net-migration Rate expressed in 
percentage. The doubling time of a population is calculated by dividing 
70 by the growth rate of the population.

C Distribution
What is population distribution? What are the factors that affect the distribution 
of population? Which areas in Africa are most populous? Why?
Population distribution refers to the way people inhabit and occupy the earth’s 
surface. As elsewhere in the rest of the world, Africa’s population distribution 
is uneven. As a result, there are areas of high and low population density. Some 
parts of the continent, particularly the vast Sahara, have few permanent residents. 
While, others rank among the world’s most densely populated areas. The Nile 
Valley of Egypt, the Atlantic coastal area that stretches from Côte d’Ivoire to 
Cameroon, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Africa’s province of KwaZulu-Natal are 
among the most densely populated areas in the continent. The continent’s average 
crude population density during the mid of 2009 was about 33 people/km2
. 
Certain human and physical factors are responsible for such spatial variation in 
the distribution of population in the continent. Among the physical factors some 
are climate, relief, availability of water, fertility of soil, distribution of minerals 
and the like. On the other hand, the human factors that determine the extent 
to which humans inhabit a certain place include economic conditions, political 
situations and other social factors.
However, there exists a significant regional variation in population density. As it 
can be seen from the following table, Eastern Africa has the continent’s highest 
crude density of 49 p/km2
 followed by Western Africa with 48 p/km2
. Contrary to 
Figure 4.1: Africa density of population, 2008 
Unit 4: Population, Economy and Natural Resources of Africa 195
4.1 Aspects Of Population, Economy And Natural Resources Of Africa 4.1 Aspects Of Population, Economy And Natural Resources Of Africa
this, central Africa has the continent’s lowest crude density of 19 p/km2
 followed 
by Southern Africa (22 p/km2
) and Northern Africa (24 p/km2
).

On country level, the most populous countries are Nigeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Republic of South Africa 
(RSA). These countries all together account for about 43% of the continent’s total 
population. In terms of population density, while some are heavily populated, 
others have very low population density. The following table gives you the ten 
most densely and most sparsely populated countries of Africa.

4.1.2 Determinants of Population Change 
in Africa 
Brainstorming
1 Do you remember what you learnt about population change in your previous 
grades? 
2 Which demographic variables are responsible to bring population change in a 
given region or country? 
The three components that determine population change are birth rate, death rate 
and migration. Population change in a given country is affected by: 
F The difference between deaths and births also known as natural change 
F The balance between immigration (coming in) and emigration (going 
out) also known as net migration.

4.1 Aspects Of Population, Economy And Natural Resources Of Africa 4.1 Aspects Of Population, Economy And Natural Resources Of Africa
In Africa, the current population change (growth) is a function of fertility, 
mortality and migration. There is frequent migration of people within a country. 
However, these days there are not significant migrant flows from country 
to country or from region to region due to lack of pulling factors. Since most 
African countries are in their lower stage of development, there are little or no 
opportunities to accommodate a huge influx of people from another country. 
Africa’s migration pattern is highly related to political instabilities and natural 
catastrophes. 
Fertility Patterns in Africa
What is fertility? What are the factors that affect the fertility rate of the African 
population?
Fertility refers to the occurrence of birth in the human population. It is a natural 
positive factor that tends to increase the human population size. Africa’s fertility 
rate is the highest in the world. Birth rates are high in Africa because: 
F people have less access to contraceptives; 
F people are backward and poverty stricken; 
F women are of low status; 
F many children are needed to work on the land; 
F children are considered as symbol of virility; 
F people are of low educational background; and
F many religions encourage large families. 
According to the UN World population prospects of the year 2009, the average 
birth rate for Africa is estimated at 36/1000. This is the highest even for the 
standard of developing countries, which is (22/1000).

Activity 4.2
Discuss in group about the following issues.
1 Africa’s population growth rate is the highest in the world. What will happen if 
Africa’s population growth rate continues in such a manner? 
2 Some developed countries’ population growth rate is stagnant. The old age 
population number is growing from time to time. What sort of implication will 
this bring upon the socio-economic condition of these countries? 
Although fertility is high in Africa, it still varies from country to country or region 
to region. Currently African countries having birth rates below 30/1000 include: 
F Mauritius 14/1000
F Tunisia 17/1000
F Morocco 21/1000
F South Africa 23/1000

F Reunion 18/1000
F Libya 24/1000
F Namibia 25/1000 
F Algeria 23/1000 
F Lesotho 27/1000 
Other African countries comprise rates ranging from 31/1000 in Swaziland to 
50/1000 in Guinea Bissau and Nigeria.

N.B. Ethiopia’s CBR was about 39/1000 in 2009.
Table 4.7 shows the status of Africa in terms of crude birth and death rates and 
life expectancy vividly. Central Africa, for instance, had the highest birth rate 42 
births per 1000 population followed by Eastern and Western Africa each of which 
was having 40 birth per 1000 population. 
Focus 
Birth rate is defined as the number of live births per 1000 population in 
a year. For example, when we say the birth rate of Africa is 36/1000, 
we mean that 36 births will occur for every 1000 people, on the average, 
every other year. 
Death rate is the number of deaths per 1000 population in a year. For 
example, Africa’s death rate is 12/1000. This is to say that 12 deaths will 
occur for every 1000 people on the average every other year. 
The difference between birth rate and death rate is conceived as a difference 
influenced by natural change. The natural change for Africa can, therefore, be 
computed as: 
 36/1000 – 12/1000 or (36/1000 (birth rate) – 12/1000 (death rate))
 
2.4% is the natural increase for Africa 
There is an inverse relationship between the level of economic development and 
the fertility rate. In Africa, the regions that have a relatively better economic 
progress are likely to have low rate of fertility. 
Mortality Patterns in Africa
What is mortality? How does it affect the population of Africa? What are the 
factors that affect mortality in Africa?
Simply defined, mortality refers to the occurrence of death in the human 
population. As was shown in Table 4.7 Africa’s mortality rate is the highest in 
×
24 100 = 2.4%
1000 =

4.1 Aspects Of Population, Economy And Natural Resources Of Africa
the world. It is also the highest even from the perspective of the developing 
regions. The continent had a crude death rate of 12 deaths per 1000 population. 
When regional comparison is made, death rate ranges from 7/1000 in Northern 
Africa to 15/1000 in Southern Africa. In terms of infant mortality rate, which is 
the death of infants under one year per 1000 live births, the continent still has 
the world’s largest rate of 74 deaths per 1000 live births. Infant mortality rates 
also vary from region to region. Accordingly, Central Africa has the highest rate 
of 95/1000 followed by Western Africa 80/1000 and Eastern Africa 76/1000 live 
births. The lowest Infant Mortality rate is in Northern Africa which only 38/1000.
Africa’s high death rate is attributed to the following major factors: 
F Low standard of living
F Low access to health facilities
F Poor sanitary practices
F Civil war and political instability
F Wide spread of famine caused by recurrent drought
F Poor nutrition, and
F High incidence of disease and infections
Africa’s death rate is declining since world war II due to development in medical 
technology, and sanitary practices, and the discovery of medicines and vaccines 
for tropical diseases. However, the continent’s crude death rate remains being 
the highest in the world.
Focus 
Infant mortality rate is generally regarded as a prime indicator of 
socioeconomic development. Infant mortality has declined from 138/1000 
in 1950 to 88/1000 in 1975 – 80; and now, it is down to 74/1000. 
There is disparity in life expectancy between rich and poor countries. But this has 
shown a significant converge over the last 50 years despite widening wealth gap 
between them.

What would you conclude about Africa’s population from the point of view of 
its birth and death rates? 
The current birth and death rates of Africa reflect a very young (and economically 
dependent) population of low life expectancy. Almost all sub-Saharan countries 
have a population of under 15 years of age rated in percent at more than 40. 
This has resulted in high dependency ratio in the continent. The average life 
expectancy for the whole continent is 54 years. (Table 4.9)

Africa’s life expectancies are the lowest in the world. There is though, a wide 
disparity of this fact from regions to regions within Africa ranging from 69 years 
for Northern Africa to 49 years for Eastern and Western Africa. 
Migration
What is migration? Why do people migrate? 
Migration is a socio-cultural components of population change. It has both 
negative and positive impacts based on its net effect. A negative net migration 
rate tends to reduce the population of region. On the other hand, a positive net 
migration rate tends to increase population size.
The third component of population change is migration. It is an important control 
of population change next to fertility and mortality. Migration is the movement 
of people from their home place to another one. The most important aspects in 
the study of migration are its motives. The motives leading to migration in Africa 
include: 
F prevalence of diverse and wide range of climatic zones 
F presence of diverse and multitude natural resources 
F coincidence of the continent’s large size 
F pervasiveness of varying economic activities ranging from agriculture 
to trade: and existence of divergent level of economic and social 
development. 
4.1.3 Characteristics of African Population 
Brainstorming
1 What does characteristics of population mean? 
2 What are the major characteristics of African population? 
The structure or composition of African population falls under two categories 
classified thus on grounds of biological and cultural characteristics. Biological 
characteristics include race, ethnicity, sex and age. The cultural characteristics 
comprise education, health, nutrition, religion, occupation, and the like. 
Unit 4: Population, Economy and Natural Resources of Africa 203

Biological Characteristics
Age structure 
How do you describe the age composition of Africa’s population?
Africa is a continent which one can deduce, could be characterized by young 
population (See Table 4.10). This can be easily identified from the median age. If 
the median age is low, it implies that the population is young; for example, Africa’s 
median age is 18 years. In contrast, if the median age is high, the population is 
likely to be adult and old age group; for example the median age for Europe is 
37 years. Low median age reflects high fertility and high population growth rates 
whereas high median age prevails in a population where population growth rate 
is low and slow (See Figure 4.3 ).

Activity 4.3
1 Which continent is characterized by the highest percentage of young 
population? 
2 Which continent comprises the lowest percentage of young age population 
and highest old age population. 
3 Explain briefly the impact of having high percentage of young population on 
socio- economic changes. 
4 Discuss the benefits and problems of young dependent population and adult 
(economically active) population. 
5 Why is a large elderly dependent population generally viewed as a problem?
As it is shown in Table 4.10 , Africa is the only continent which comprises high 
young population, but very low old age population. In developing continents like 
Africa, the level of fertility is very high; and so the rate of population growth is 
high, too. This is readily attributed to their predominantly youthful age structure. 
As high fertility persists, the pressure on scarce resources for development 
increases. The demand for food, education, health facilities, employment 
opportunities, housing and other services also increases. In order to maximize 
these needs so as to meet the demand of the growing population, physical and 
institutional infrastructures have to be increased abundantly. 
Persisting high rate of population growth constantly dwarfs whatever is achieved 
in the economic sector. Resources which could be used for development purposes, 
could be shifted to the provision of basic supply for the additional members. 
Activity 4.4
Discuss in group how to get rid of population pressure caused by high fertility rate. 
The Demographic structure of a given country (region) is best illustrated by the 
use of population pyramids (like the one in Figure 4.4). Population pyramids are 
used to portray the proportion of males and females in different age groups. In 
Figure 4.4 below, each bar represents a five year age group apart from the upper 
most bar which illustrates the population above 85 years. The male population is 
shown on the left of the vertical axis; and that of the females, on the right. 
Unit 4: Population, Economy and Natural Resources of Africa 205
4.1 Aspects Of Population, Economy And Natural Resources Of Africa 4.1 Aspects Of Population, Economy And Natural Resources Of Africa
As it is portrayed in the figure above, the population pyramid for Sweden: 
F is a narrow pyramid indicating equal numbers in each age group. 
F reflects a low birth rate and a low death rate indicating a steady and 
static population growth. 
F illustrates that more females live over 75 years than males do. 
F gives a picture of the fact that a large proportion of the population is in 
the pre- and post-reproductive age groups and that a small number is in 
the 15 – 64 age group, which is the one that produces children and most 
of the national wealth. 
F This can be shown in the dependency ratio expressed as: 
Economically dependent Children (0 – 14) and elderly (65+)
Economically active Working age (15 – 64)
Let us take hypothetical countries called “X” and “Y” to calculate dependency 
ratio.

Figure 4.4: Population Pyramid 
Grade 11 Geography 206
4.1 Aspects Of Population, Economy And Natural Resources Of Africa
i The dependency ratio for country x is: 
The number of dependent population under-15 years = 13,387,000 
Number of old age (dependent) population > 64 = 7,307,000
Number of independents 15 – 64 = 31,616,000 
Therefore, the age dependency ratio of country “X” is 65.45% 
This simply means, for every 100 people of working age, there are 65.45 
people who depend on them. 
ii Country Y’s dependency ratio is: 
The dependency ratio is, therefore, 87%. 
The above dependency ratio is explained as for every 100 economically active 
people. The case country “Y”, for instance, can be stated as: there are 87 persons 
that depend up on 100 persons. This dependency ratio is the highest in the world.

Sex Structure 
Sex ratio is an important demographic characteristics. It refers to the proportion of 
males to females in the overall population of a given area. Sex ratio is expressed 
in terms of the number of males for every 100 females. 
Sex Ratio = Male Popualtion 100
Female Population
×
Sex ratio is an important indicator of the economy of a given country and is 
useful for regional analysis. The proportion of the two sexes in the population 
of a region has impact on other demographic elements such as marriage rate, 
occupational structure, growth, etc. 
With regard to sex ratio, Sub-Saharan Africa sex ratio is below the world’s 
average which is less than 98%. This means there are 98 males per 100 females, 
which is equitably balanced. Most Sub-Saharan African countries, however, have 
sex ratio of far less than 100. That is to say, there are greater number of women 
than men. Such an event is associated with a huge loss of men population 
due to war and migration. In some countries of the region, though, male births 
consistently exceed female births due to combined biological and social reasons. 
Some among such countries are equatorial Guinea, Uganda, Gambia and Kenya. 
The context of high sex ratio in these countries is attributed to the prevalence of a 
large number of immigrants. The fact that these countries exceptionally comprise 
high sex ratio for reasons of immigration indicates that migration is age and sex 
selective. If there is a large influx of population to a given country, then that 
country will have high sex ratio. High sex ratio means a large proportion of active 
population age group will be added to that country.

1 What does the word migration mean? 
2 What are the two types of migration? 
Migration
The two major types of migration which bring about population change and effect 
its distribution are: 
A Internal migration B International migration 
A Internal Migration
What is internal migration?
When people move from one part of a country to another part, we say internal 
migration has taken place. Internal movement of this kind is practised in many 
parts of Africa. Internal migrations are caused mainly by economic reasons. 
Internal migrations are of two types, namely, 
F permanent and F temporary. 
Unit 4: Population, Economy and Natural Resources of Africa 209
4.1 Aspects Of Population, Economy And Natural Resources Of Africa 4.1 Aspects Of Population, Economy And Natural Resources Of Africa
Permanent migration refers to peoples movement from their original place of 
residence to another where they establish a new residence on a permanent basis. 
Another form of permanent internal migration is the urban to rural migration. 
This one is also known as the return migration. In such migration, people who 
are unable to find job that can sustain their family in the city move back to their 
old places. Such people include retired people from civil service and those who 
worked and lived in cities for a long period of time. 
Temporary migration involves the movement of people whereby they leave their 
original residence for another for a short period of time, and then come back to their 
original place. Such migration is often practised only periodically. For example, 
people move from one area to another to find seasonal job. The Migration of 
labourors from the densely populated highland regions of Ethiopia to the middle 
Awash valley during the seasons of sugar cane plantation and harvesting is a clear 
illustration of this trend. Similarly many young people migrate from east and 
west Gojjam, Tigray, Wollo and Gondar to nearby towns to avail themselves at 
employment opportunities accessible only seasonally. 
Temporary migration can also take place on annual or diurnal basis. Many people 
move from small towns to large cities in Africa every day seeking employment or 
running into other purposes. 
Another internal migration is related to a rural-rural one. This type of migration is 
attributed to pushing and pulling factors. Examine the illustration below.

Internal migration takes the following forms:
F Rural-urban
F Rural-rural
F Urban-rural
F Urban-urban
Migration may emanate from a combination of reasons. These include: 
aversion of residence: This is to mean that people may migrate if they 
dislike certain things about their residence. Such unfavorable conditions 
are referred to as pushing factors or repellent reasons for migration. 
F people may migrate to a new place because they think certain 
conditions about that place are all active and welcoming. These are 
known as pulling factors. 
B International Migration 
What is international migration?
When people move from one country to another, wherever this may be in the 
world, we say International migration has taken place. International migration 
happens in various forms and has a long history. Several migrations took place 
before the colonial era. The most important movements were accompanied by 
Slave Trade whereby Africans were enslaved and taken to the America’s and 
Middle East. This form of emigration persisted for about 300 years. 
The other wave of migration was that of people from the Middle East and South 
Asia to Africa. These were the first Arab (Semites) migrants to Africa before 
the slave trade. These people inhabited North Africa starting from the 7th and 8th
centuries and spread their language, religion and culture all over Northern Africa 
and the Sahara. These people are known as the Berbers and comprise 25% of the 
total population of Africa.

Focus 
Brain-drain is the movement of highly educated people such as engineers, 
researchers, lawyers, university instructors, medical doctors, etc from 
their country to countries abroad (overseas) where working conditions 
and payments are thought to be better. 
Intra-continental migration: this is movement of people within the same 
continent, in the present case, within African countries. This kind of migration is 
usually done by labourers and is known as labour migration. 
Labour migrants are motivated by ample remunerations provided by 
establishments engaged in plantation agriculture and discovery of mineral 
deposit. These conditions have brought about the divergence in economic growth 
among African countries. 
The places involved in plantation agriculture and the mining sector that attract a 
large number of people from different parts of Africa include the: 
F Cacao belt of Ghana and Western Nigeria. 
F Citrus and Vine plantation of Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. 
F Tobacco plantation of Zimbabwe and Zambia. 
F Sisal, Coffee and tea regions of Kenya and Tanzania

Urbanization 
Brainstorming
1 What does the word urban mean? 
2 What is urbanization? 
3 Try to recall what you learnt in grade ten about urbanization and give answers 
to these two questions. 
Urban is defined as relating or belonging to town or city. Urban centres are 
settlements where the majority of the population is engaged in non-agricultural 
occupation. 
Urbanization refers to an increase in the proportion of people living in towns and 
cities. It is a major aspect of socio-economic change. 
Africa is the least urbanized of all the continents in the world. As compared 
to the other regions of the world, the continent has the least number of urban 
populations. On average, it is only 38% of the continent’s population that lives 
in urban areas. However, as a result of the existing very high rate of rural-urban 
migration and high fertility in the urban areas, the continent has the world’s highest 
rate of urbanization, which is about 5.4% per year. Furthermore, the continent is 
characterized by low level of urbanization. The living conditions, social services, 
housing conditions and transport and communication facilities are very low in 
the urban areas of the continent. It is also true to say that the continent has the 
world’s least number of urban dwellers and urban centres.

The extent of urbanization shows great regional variation in Africa. As it can 
clearly be observed from the table below, Southern Africa is the most urbanized 
region with 56% of its population living in urban areas in 2009 followed by 
Northern Africa (50%). Contrary to this, Eastern Africa is the least urbanized 
region having only 22% of its population residing in the urban areas. In terms of 
rate of urbanization, there exists regional variation too. The highest in this regard 
is that of Eastern Africa (6.8%) followed by Western Africa (5.5%).

Rapid urbanization is causing several challenges in Africa. It creates problems on 
employment opportunities, housing conditions, provision of social services such 
as education and health services, and social security in the urban areas. It has also 
resulted in unplanned development of urban centres in many African countries. 
Consequently, many urban areas of the continent have poor road networks, 
sewerage channels and unplanned settlements which resulted in the development 
of slum or squatter settlements. Rapid urbanization in Africa is also affecting the 
rural economy. This is due to the high rural-urban migration that takes the rural 
labour force out to the urban areas leaving the farms in the rural areas for the 
children and old. In addition, it has also facilitated the expansion of social evils 
like crime, prostitution and the like. 
Urban Growth and Major Urban Centres in Africa
The movement of people to cities in Africa began in early 20th century. Since 
then, many cities have expanded at a rate of 25 percent every ten years (decade). 
The movement from rural areas to towns and cities is dubbed as rural – urban

migration. Figure 4.8 shows that in most African countries movement to the cities 
is partly due to rural push and partly due to urban pull.

Current Urban Challenges
The outcome of rapid urbanization in Africa is that they pose challenges to the 
growing cities. Cities serve as major growth engines by providing opportunities 
for employment, education, technology, etc. These conditions, in turn, transfer 
markets for industrial and agricultural products; consequently, urbanization leads 
to further expansion of the cities where by their peripheral areas end up in changes 
of land use. The conversion of farm lands and watersheds for residential purposes 
has negative results in food security, water supply and the health of the people. 
The adverse effects of urbanization in Africa are absence of employment 
opportunity, unreliable food security, shortage of water, scarcity of shelter and 
inefficient waste disposal, etc.

places. It has been estimated that Africa will have eleven mega-cities (i.e., cities 
having five million inhabitants) and about 3000 cities with populations of more 
than 20,000 by the year 2020. See Table 4.15 below.

Unlike other regions of the world, urbanization in Africa has not contributed 
significant economics of scale and value added productive chains, to the growth 
in GDP. South East Asia and Africa have had similar rates of urbanization 
(4 – 5 % perannum) for the period 1970 – 95. However, while East Asia outshined 
by about 3.7% per annum whereas sub - Saharan Africa’s GDP declined by 66%. 
Many unique factors including immigration of destitute citizens affected by wars, 
drought and famine, have contributed to this phenomenon in urban Africa. What 
is more, difficult transitions from neo-apartheid colonial regimes to fragile self 
governance and crushing external debt (81% of GDP in Africa compared to 33% 
in East Asia) have added up to this problem.

4 How do we distinguish a developed economy from developing one? 
5 How do you describe the trend of economic development in Africa?
“Economic growth” and “development” are terms that we use to refer to the state 
of economic conditions in a certain society. Even if both are used to describe 
existing economic conditions, they still differ from each other in the ways they 
are employed. The term “economic growth” is used to describe the increase in 
the total amount of production and wealth of a given economy. As it is related to 
wealth, it focuses on explaining how fast the production and wealth of a country 
increases. Economic growth is usually quantitative as it is related to increasing 
production of goods and services, thereby allowing a state conceive how much 
income it has generated. On the other hand, economic development refers to 
growth in structural and technological change. Because of this, development 
is both quantitative and qualitative in that it involves increment in production, 
service provision and income implies, improvements in the over all living 
conditions of the population. That is why most agree to the idea that a growing 
economy can definitely promote development.

Growth versus Development
Economic growth may be one aspect of economic development but is not 
the same
F Economic growth is a measure of the value of output of goods and 
services within a certain period of time. 
F Economic Development: is a measure of the welfare of human 
beings in a certain state. 
Naturally, the agricultural sector absorbs the majority of the labour force as it 
is the main sector of production in the early stages of development. With the 
advent of growth, the manufacturing and service sectors become dominant. 
Consequently, diversified economic conditions with higher division of labour 
develop. Hence, we can say that development is the promotion of more intensive 
and more advanced economic activity with such inputs as education, improved 
tools and techniques of production, more available financing, better transportation 
facilities, and other booming businesses.
Economic development is characterized by the following:
F The increased utilization of the natural resources of a state in order to 
raise people’s standard of living and to improve the quality of life.
F The production of more and more goods and services that enter into 
markets for sale. For example, we know that people always eat, but as 
they have meals away from home and pay for restaurant services, the 
restaurant sector grows up. 
F The growth in GDP (for instance, the sector listed earlier on in turn, is 
measured as part of the gross domestic product (GDP) i.e., the total of 
all goods and services produced within a country. 
F Division of Labor: the process of development includes specialization 
in specific area of labour, which consequently leads to “division of 
labour.” As people take on specialized economic functions, the scale 
of production increases and the output of each person rises. This 
type of organizational change is an important part of development as 
technological progress and mechanical invention or scientific discovery.
Grade 11 Geography 222
4.2 Concepts Of Economic Growth And Development
F Significant changes in the technical and institutional arrangements by 
means of which out put is produced and distributed.
In general, development is understood as a complex and continuous process that 
involves people on one hand, and the factors of production and organization on 
the other. In other words, development is a process by way of which members of a 
society increase their personal and institutional capacities to mobilize and manage 
resources and to produce sustainable goods and services for their improved life.
Economic growth may not necessarily mean economic development. However, a 
growing economy paves the way for development. As we know countries of the 
world are categorized into two as developed and developing. But the question 
is how do we determine whether a certain economy is developed or not? What 
are the factors that determine the level of the economic development of a certain 
society? There are indicators of economic development that can help us answer 
these questions which we shall see them later.
4.2.2 Economic Growth And Development 
Trend In Africa
How do you describe the trend in Africa’s socio-economic development?
Africa is generally regarded as a developing continent. Many countries in it have 
very low GDP and per capita income. As a result, the majority of the African people 
ache from the pain of low standard of living. Historically, the primary economic 
sector in general and agriculture in particular has been the dominant economic 
activity in the continent. The very low national wealth of African countries that 
resulted in low per capita income has always been the factor that determined 
the low standard of living of the continent’s population. Consequently, low 
GDP, low income per capita, poor housing conditions, poor transport, inefficient 
communication networks, low educational and health coverage, widely spread 
unemployment, high mortality rate soaring human fertility and indecent life 
characterize the living conditions of millions of peoples in Africa. The following 
discussion gives you some idea about the trend of economic development that 
Africa has come through since its earliest record of history.

F Subsistence economy that is principally based on crop production 
and animal husbandry has dominated the economy of Africa 
since prehistoric times.
F Long-distance trade networks that promoted the exchange of raw 
materials and some specialized local goods between a few African 
states were developed in pre-colonial times. 
F As overseas demand for certain African agricultural and mineral 
products increased during European colonization, the colonizers began 
constructing new transportation networks and introduced technological 
innovations and new crops; this trend has continued since the 15th 
century. 
F One-way trade systems in which Africa’s wealth of raw materials were 
exported to enrich foreign assets, with little regard for development 
within Africa, was what European colonies in Africa were involved in 
by the mid-20th century.
F As decolonization began in the late 1950s, the traditional rural economic 
sector supporting the majority, and a relatively modern sector that was 
based in cities and at mining and plantation sites, began to dominate. 
F After independence, African governments began to take development 
initiative to improve the standard of living of their population. As a 
result, industries producing consumer goods and other service providing 
sectors such as education and health care began to grow.

F Rapid population growth in the second half of the 20th century, especially 
in the 1980s and 1990s, retarded, once again, the development of many 
African economies.
F Now, despite all the efforts made by African governments, the different 
economic sectors, especially the primary and secondary sectors are 
far from being integrated. Traditional subsistence activities are still 
dominant. Similarly, despite increasing levels of industrialization in 
many countries of Africa, the continent’s raw materials continue to be 
produced primarily for export.

Figure 4.11: Africa by HDI
The modern economic sector of Africa was developed largely by Europeans 
during the colonial era and was geared toward the export of raw materials. 
Industrialization was and still minimum. Following independence, many 
African governments introduced industrialization programs with varying 
success. At present, many African states face the challenge of expanding 
their economies to fulfil the needs of their people while maintaining their 
profitable export-oriented activities.

types to diverse climate, enormous mineral wealth, energy sources, wildlife and 
huge human power. 
Despite the continent’s richness in resource potential, Africa falls far behind 
from fully exploiting its resources. Though soils with varying quality and 
diverse climate are common in Africa, agriculture is still less productive and at 
subsistence level. The huge energy potential of Africa in terms of hydro-electric 
power, solar energy and fossil fuels is also practically untapped. Minerals are also 
not well extracted even in areas where the extraction of such minerals as gold and 
diamond is said to be well developed. The wealth is rather more of a cause for 
conflict and civil war than for development. Pertaining to the huge manpower, 
We can safely make a sweeping statement that it is still less employed in highly 
productive activities; we reckon that the majority of Africans are engaged in 
subsistence agricultural activities.
Indicators of Development
How do we determine whether a certain socio-economic system is developed or 
developing? What are the major indicators of development?
Needless to say that development is a measurable concept. But, yes, It can be 
measured by using different indices that are called indicators of development. 
The component parts of the set of indicators indicate the level of development 
that a given society achieves. However, before rushing to these indicators, let us 
take up the following activity. 
Activity 4.10
In a small group, discuss on the following questions and share your ideas with your 
classmates.
1 When do you say that an economy is developed or developing?
2 Do you know any factors that are capable of indicating how well an economy is 
developed? Mention as many indicators as you can if you think you know some.
Major Indicators of Development 
Can you mention some of the socio-economic conditions that can tell about the 
level of development of a certain society?
Grade 11 Geography 226
4.2 Concepts Of Economic Growth And Development
The level at which a certain economy is said to be developed is directly linked 
with three most important conditions that are considered as major indicators 
of development. These are the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Per capita 
income (GNP per capita) and the Standard of living of a certain population.
Activity 4.11
Answer the following questions.
1 What is GDP?
2 What is GNP? What about GNP per capita?
3 What are the indicators of good standard of living?
a Gross domestic product (GDP): GDP refers to the total value of goods and 
services produced in a country over a period of time. It can be calculated 
by either adding up the value of all goods and services produced, or the 
expenditure on goods and services at the time of sale, or producers’ incomes 
from the sale of goods or services. However, measuring GDP precisely is 
quite cumbersome. This is partly because every country has an unofficial 
economy that is often called a black economy that includes businesses that 
are not reported to government. Furthermore, GDP measures a country’s 
economic activity regardless of who owns the productive assets in that 
country. For example, the output of Holland-owned companies based 
in Ethiopia is considered part of Ethiopia’s GDP rather than part of the 
Holland GDP. The amount of GDP an economy has as well as the major 
sectors of contributors to the GDP of a country are important indicators of 
development. Another term, Gross National Product (GNP) is also used to 
measure a nation’s wealth. GNP refers to the total annual flow of goods and 
services in the economy of a nation in monetary value. It includes income 
from within and out side of the state.
b Percapita income: This one refers to the average amount of money that an 
individual is expected to have as a result of the state’s GNP. It is computed 
by dividing the GNP of a country by the total number of its people. As it is a 
crude measure, per cpita income does not tell who exactly gets how much. 
However, it indicates how much each individual in a state can potentially 
get if the total GNP of the state is evenly distributed among all people. 
Unit 4: Population, Economy and Natural Resources of Africa 227
4.2 Concepts Of Economic Growth And Development 4.2 Concepts Of Economic Growth And Development
Though not an actual income of an individual, we can generally deduce 
that the higher the per capita income of a nation is, the higher standard of 
living and vice-versa.
c Standard of living: This is the threshold of material security measured 
by the availability of resources for an individual, family, or society. It is 
perhaps the best measurement of the quality of life of people in a given 
society. The standard of living that people have in a state is directly related 
to both GDP and per capita income. Hence, in economies we say that where 
we have higher GDP and per capita income, people have better standard of 
living. Contrary to this, people in countries with low GDP and per capita 
income have low standard of living. 
These three factors are strictly interrelated to one another. Thus, a higher GDP 
means higher per capita income. Likewise, a higher per capita income means 
better living condition. In well developed economies, there is high GDP, per 
capita income and standard of living. Consequently, the things that are essential 
to satisfy the needs of the population are readily available. The following chart 
shows you how each of these concepts influence the other.
The following table gives you a highlight of the basic features that characterize 
developing and developed countries.

4.2.3 Characteristics of African Economy
What are the major characteristics of Africa’s economy?
Africa is the least developed of all the continents in the World. Its economy 
is primarily dependent on the primary economic sector. The lion’s share of 
Unit 4: Population, Economy and Natural Resources of Africa 229
4.2 Concepts Of Economic Growth And Development 4.2 Concepts Of Economic Growth And Development
the continent’s population earns its livelihood from such activities as shifting 
cultivation, crop production and animal husbandry. Hence, agriculture is by far 
the most important economic activity in the continent employing the majority of 
the labour force and being the main source of foodstuffs, industrial raw materials, 
and exportable items which provide the main source of foreign currency. 
Extraction of minerals, catching fish and other marine creatures and fetching 
gums from forests, which constitute the primary economic sector, are also major 
economic activities in which many Africans are engaging in. 
The secondary and tertiary economic sectors are less developed in the continent, 
since these are recent developments. Most of the manufacturing industries are 
cottage types; the majority of the modern manufacturing industries are light 
industries that focus on the production of consumer goods. Heavy industries that 
could produce machineries, air crafts, ships and automobiles are almost nonexistent in the continent, except a few. Regarding the service sector, it is still far 
behind a higher level of development. Transport and communication networks 
are underdeveloped. Trading undertakings, both inter and intra-continental ones, 
are again, far less developed. Education and health care services are poorly 
developed and so is tourism. 
Generally, the following are the major characteristics of the economy of Africa.
F It is largely dependent on the agricultural sector. In almost all countries 
of the continent, agriculture is the:
K backbone of the economy;
K main source of employment, industrial raw materials, foodstuff 
and exportable items;
K main source of foreign currency; and
K major contributor to the GDP of almost all countries.
F Other primary economic activities like fishing, forestry, mining, bee 
keeping and poultry, though all important, are less developed.
F The economy of many African countries is at less level of industrialization. 
Manufacturing industries are few in number and are confined to few 
urban centres. 
F Inter continental, intra-regional and intra-continental trade is at low 
level. Commerce between African countries and regions is neutralized 
by similarity of products, lack of common currency, lack of foreign 
currency and poor communication networks of all kinds. Africa’s 
Grade 11 Geography 230
4.2 Concepts Of Economic Growth And Development
international trade is dominated by the exportation of raw materials 
and importation of manufactured goods to and from the developed 
nations. This, in turn, makes Africa’s trade balance feeble.
F Communication facilities, including land, air, and sea transport, 
telephone, fax and telegram are all poor, causing low level of socioeconomic and political interconnections among the countries and 
peoples of the continent.
F The various economic sectors of the continent run short of capital, skilled 
human power and efficient technology. As a result, most of the sectors 
remain dependent on insufficient local capital investment, traditional 
know-how of production and backward traditional technology.
F As a result of low GDP and meager per capita income, the majority 
of the people live in poverty. Many countries also fail to provide basic 
social services such as education and health. Consequently, widely 
spread mass poverty, illiteracy and poor health conditions prevail in 
many countries.
4.2.4 Present Features of Africa’s Socioeconomic Development
Brainstorming
1 How do you describe the existing socio-economic conditions of Africa?
2 Do you think that the existing situations are sufficiently enough for Africa to 
attain a better economic development in the near future?
3 What do you think would happen to Africa if the current conditions persist? 
4 Do you think that African states and governments should develop new plans 
for their socio-economic development? Why?
5 What contributions could NEPAD have to Africa’s development?
The overall socio-economic development conditions in Africa seem to be vague 
and unpredictable. While few countries of Northern and Southern Africa such 
as Egypt and the Republic of South Africa have better levels of socio-economic 
development, the majority of the states are characterized by very low socioeconomic conditions. GDP is very low as the economy of the majority of the 
states in the continent is based mainly on the primary sector the outputs of 
which fail to be far from subsistence. Consequently, the share of individuals of 
Unit 4: Population, Economy and Natural Resources of Africa 231
4.2 Concepts Of Economic Growth And Development 4.2 Concepts Of Economic Growth And Development
the national wealth, i.e., the concept per capita income, is precisely meager to 
enable Africans lead a better standard of living. As a result, poor and substandard 
housing conditions, inadequate provision of health and education services, 
poorly developed social infrastructure such as transport and communication 
facilities, malnutrition, illiteracy, and widely spread unemployment have become 
commonly observed phenomena in the continent.
Particularly, the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are much affected by the 
conditions just stated above. Their tropical location coupled with intermittent 
inter- and intra-state conflicts, poor governance, corruption and poor infrastructure 
have made the region’s backward socio-economic conditions. Though the 
continent is believed to have huge potential of natural resources that range from 
soils with varying quality to high labour potential, just a little of these resources 
has actually been utilized to improve the existing socio-economic conditions. 
Furthermore, the effects of colonialism have also played their part on the current 
socio-economic conditions of many formerly colonized states. The dependency 
of the colonies on their ex-colonizers in terms of trade relations and other socioeconomic and political issues is exerting a lot of impact on their development. 
Because of all the above situations, Africa stands at the fore front of low level 
of socio-economic development in the world. It is in fact, the least developed 
continent having the majority of its population living in a desperate situation. The 
majority of African’s do not have better access to health and education services or 
to a better housing or rewarding employment. Fertility is high and population is 
growing rapidly despite the relative decline in morality rates in many countries. 
Though on a rise, life expectancy at birth is still very low and is the lowest as 
compared to the rest of the continents in the world. Adult illiteracy rates are high 
and even most school age children fail to get access to primary education. Clean 
water, adequate power supply and safe and healthy environments are far placed 
from the people. Leaving rural areas aside, they are even not adequately provided 
in the urban centres.
Lack of capital, lack of skilled human power and lack of advanced technology 
together with conflicts and civil war, corruption, bad governance and high 
foreign debt are among the factors that negatively influence socio-economic 
developments in Africa. To day, inter and intra-state conflicts and civil wars are 
easy to observe in the continent. Corruption is widely spread from top government 
officials to lower level office holders. Diverting Africa’s limited capital resource 
from investment on social infrastructure to individual’s pockets is common place. 
Grade 11 Geography 232
4.2 Concepts Of Economic Growth And Development
Lack of good governance has resulted in lack of accountability. Formulating and 
executing development policies and programs as well as passing fundamental 
decisions on matters that could make life better in the continent have all become 
unworkable.
Debt crisis is another serious challenge of development in Africa. Due to their 
internationally disadvantaged status, nearly all African countries had to borrow 
money from foreign lenders to cover the difference between their export earnings 
and their spending for imports. The amount of accumulated external debt owed 
by Sub-Saharan African countries has risen from less than $6 billion in 1970, 
to $80 billion in 1985, to $230 billion in 1999. Interest payments to foreign 
creditors siphon away precious foreign exchange earnings. Such pressures on 
export earnings have led African governments to make stringent cuts in imports 
because of high tariffs and complete prohibitions.
The continent’s trade position has faced further dire challenges since the 1960s. 
The prices of manufactured goods and fuels imported by African countries 
1999
Figure 4.13: External Debt owned by Sub-Saharan African Countries
As  was  the  case  during colonial rule, Africa’s role in the world economy 
remains to produce raw materials for use in developed nations. Investment by 
international corporations and most foreign governments has concentrated 
on expanding production of exportable mineral and agricultural raw 
materials. The emphasis on exports has left inadequate resources for 
developing domestic industry or changing the traditional, underdeveloped 
system of African smallholder food production. Neglecting their foodproducing sectors has led African countries to increase their dependence 
on raw-material exports and has required many to import food to feed its 
people.
Unit 4: Population, Economy and Natural Resources of Africa 233
4.2 Concepts Of Economic Growth And Development 4.2 Concepts Of Economic Growth And Development
increased substantially, while the prices of almost all products of African mines 
and farms declined or fluctuated. This downturn meant that African countries not 
only had made them do with fewer needed imports, but also go into international 
debt to meet their financial requirements. Oil-exporting countries were able to 
avoid this pitfall for a time, but they too were beaten down by the collapse of 
world oil prices in the 1980s and 1990s. Africa has also been put at a disadvantage 
by the protectionist trade policies of industrialized countries, which accepted 
unprocessed raw materials tax-free but imposed substantial tariffs on imported 
products that have actually been made from their own raw materials.
4.2.5 Challenges and Prospects of 
Economic Development in Africa
Brainstorming
1 What are the major problems of economic development in Africa?
2 How far are these problems serious in the continent?
3 Do you think that there are prospective opportunities for Africa’s development?
4 What, do you think, are the roles that continental and regional organizations 
can play in the development of the continent?
Despite its second position in the world in terms of territorial and population size, 
Africa is the world’s poorest continent with stagnant socio-economic conditions. 
The continent’s economy has been suffering from serious challenges since 
earliest times. Lack of capital, skilled human power and modern technology are 
the major problems hampering its development. In addition to these, political 
instability, civil war, lack of good governance and the resultant widely spread 
corruption, maladministration, poor infrastructure and the subsequent poor 
regional inter-connectedness, poor export performance, declining industrial 
outputs, environmental degradation and many other cultural factors have 
influenced negatively the work habit of the majority of Africans, which, in turn, 
have posed as dominant factors impeding its economic development. As a result, 
the per capita income of the majority of Africans becomes very low negatively 
affecting the standard of living of the continent’s population. Social services 
are poorly developed. Health problems including HIV/AIDS and illiteracy are 
common. Saving and local capital accumulation are extremely limited. Hence, 
Grade 11 Geography 234
4.2 Concepts Of Economic Growth And Development
the economy of the majority of the countries in Africa is dependent on foreign aid 
and debt. This has created intense pressure on Africans development.
Another significant challenge for Africa’s development is rapid population 
growth. The continent’s population is increasing rapidly. As a result, Africa has the 
world’s fastest population growth rate. According to the 2009 World Population 
Data Sheet, the continent’s population has been growing at the natural rate of 
2.4%. The rate has even been higher in Sub-Saharan Africa with 2.5%. If this 
rate continues in the future, the continent’s population would double in not more 
than 30 years. With such a rapid increase in population size, Africa’s economy 
finds it difficult to meet the necessities of its people. Economic development is 
far behind from the rate at which the population of the continent is increasing. As 
a result, the limited capital of many African countries is shifting towards making 
Africans lead a subsistence life that is far from global standards. The imbalance 
between population growth and economic development in the continent is also 
becoming a source of conflict in many of its countries and regions. Resource 
competition and the increased need for means of subsistence is becoming a cause 
of inter-state and intra-state conflicts. This condition is adversely affecting the 
economy of many African states as it forces governments to shift their limited 
resource to war related expenses.
Though the current socio-economic conditions of Africa are under extreme 
pressure as a result of the problems stated above, the future of the continent seems 
to be promising some how. This is due to the establishment of so many continental, 
regional and sub regional organizations that are meant to facilitate socio-economic 
development in the continent. These organizations have different purposes. While 
some are of general purpose organizations, others are of specific ones. 
Activity 4.12
1 Do you know any one of the organizations that have been established in Africa 
for purposes just cited above?
2 Which one of these organizations is multi-purpose? What about the ones with 
specific purposes?

socio-economic development in Africa?
4 Do you think that the presence of these organizations can possibly change the 
socio - economic conditions of Africans in the near future? Why?
Unit 4: Population, Economy and Natural Resources of Africa 235
4.2 Concepts Of Economic Growth And Development 4.2 Concepts Of Economic Growth And Development
The African Union (AU), the former Organization of African Unity (OAU), is 
the only continental organization in Africa. With its new organizational structure, 
the AU is meant to promote peace, unity and cooperation in the continent. The 
organization is also meant to resolve conflicts between nations and to pacify 
hostilities. Besides these, it is meant to coordinate political, economic, cultural, 
scientific, medical, and defense policies among member states. The organs of AU 
primarily the African Development Bank, the African Court of Justice, the Pan 
African Parliament and the Security Council are working on the promotion of 
peace, security, good governance, inter connectedness and development.
In addition to AU, other regional and sub-regional organizations are also striving 
hard to improve socio-economic conditions in Africa. Among others, IGAD, 
NEPAD, SADC, COMESA and ECOWAS are the prominent ones. These 
organizations have varied purposes all of which boil down to promoting overall 
socio-economic development at regional and continental level. They work hard to 
improve trade and other socio-economic integration among member states. They 
labour to help member countries achieve better levels of development. They assist 
development efforts in different ways some of which include promoting peace, 
security and stable socio-economic conditions. They also provide financial, 
technical and technological support to member countries to help them mitigate 
their problems and foster development. The following map portrays the different 
regional organizations and their member countries.
The African Union is the largest international economic grouping on the 
continent. Its goals include the creation of a free trade area, a customs union, 
a single market, a central bank, and a common currency, thereby establishing 
economic and monetary union. The current plan is to establish an African 
Economic Community with a single currency by 2023. The African Investment 
Bank is meant to stimulate development. The AU plans also include a 
transitional African Monetary Fund leading to an African Central Bank.

From 1995 to 2005, Africa’s rate of economic growth increased, by 5% in the 
average in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably 
Angola, Sudan and Equatorial Guinea; all three of which had recently begun 
extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity. 
In Ethiopia, economic growth is being experienced. The country has been 
experiencing an average economic growth rate that exceeds 10% per year for the 
last five years. The country is also becoming one of the fast growing economies in 
Africa the situation is also being supported by the government’s effort to increase 
resource exploitation to further boost economic growth.

At the end of this section, you will be able to:
Þ relate major resources of Africa to its exploitation and development of Africa;
Þ state the actual mineral extraction methods of Africa;
Þ relate the paradox between the potential and actual resources exploitation 
in Africa; and
Þ defend for the advantages of peaceful mechanisms of conflict 
management around resource utilization in Africa against aggressive 
mechanisms.
By promoting inter-continental and international integrations and 
cooperation, these organizations are expected to foster Africa’s socioeconomic development. They are also meant to improve Africa’s position 
in the world’s socio-economic order. The organization work to make Africa 
beneficiary from the world’s economic conditions by creating situations that 
favour African countries, especially in the world trade. Through financial, 
technological and material assistance, they are trying their level best to 
change African’s socio-economic conditions. If these efforts are supported 
by progressive governmental policies and programs, Africa’s future socioeconomic development seems to be some how promising as the continent 
possesses huge but untouched natural and human resources.

As some sources indicate, Africa is a naturally endowed continent. Its landmass 
possesses huge reserve of different kinds of minerals including precious gem 
stones such as diamond and gold, and petroleum. Its varied topography makes the 
continent rich in terms of climatic resources and biodiversity. The geology of the 
continent is also a cause for the presence of various soil types with varying degree 
of fertility. Water resources are abundant in forms of rivers, lakes and swamps, 
though there are still many areas with serious shortage of water. The world’s 
second largest population of the continent is also a source of huge human power. 
Africa’s tropical location also makes it potentially conducive for the continent 
to possess tremendous solar energy. However, all these resources do not seem 
to serve the cause of the continent’s development. Instead, they are becoming 
causes of conflicts and war.

1 What are the resources that Africa is believed to be rich with?
2 What, do you think, are the roles that these resources could play in the 
development of Africa?
3 Do you think that Africa is benefiting from these resources properly? Why?
As has been stated earlier, Africa is believed to be rich in terms of human and 
material resources. The physical environment coupled with the continent’s varied 
geology makes Africa prosperous in terms of resources of various nature. Among 
others, the mineral, agricultural, water and human resources of the continent are 
of paramount importance for its future development.

5 How, do you think, can Africa’s human resource be exploited to the extent that

Mineral Resources of Africa
What are the minerals that Africa is well known for in the world market?
Africa’s geology consists of various types of rocks and fuel oil. This makes the 
continent rich in mineral resources. Geographically, Northern Africa is rich in 
petroleum resources. West and Central Africa are also major regions with huge 
petroleum reserves. Metallic minerals and other gem stones are abundant in 
Southern Africa. 
As some estimates indicate, Africa has 90% of the world’s cobalt and platinum, 
50% of the world’s gold, 98% of the world’s chromium, 70% of the world’s 
tantalite, 64% of the world’s manganese and one-third of the world’s uranium. 
The DRC alone has 70% of the world’s coltan (ore of Tantalum) and more than 
30% of the world’s diamond reserve. Guinea is the world’s largest exporter of 
bauxite (ore of aluminum). 
North African countries constitute one of the world’s major centres of oil 
production. Libya, Algeria and Nigeria are among Africa’s leading producers of 
crude petroleum. Algeria has a huge reserve of natural gas, as well. North Africa 
is also rich in phosphate deposits and production, Morocco being the world’s 
leader in its output. Coal, iron ore, uranium, platinum, lead, zinc, and cobalt are 
also available in Northern Africa, though to a lesser extent.
Significant amount of oil reserve is also found in Western and CentralAfrica. With 
Nigeria being Africa’s top petroleum producer. Other important oil-producing 
countries of the region include Angola, Gabon, and the Republic of the Congo. 
These regions also possess some of the world’s most significant sources of cobalt, 
manganese, potash, bauxite, and copper. Guinea alone has about one-third of the 
world’s reserves of bauxite. Other minerals of significant economic importance 
Grade 11 Geography 240
4.3 Natural Resources Of Africa And Its Politics
in the regions are iron ore, gold, diamond, tin, uranium, phosphate, columbite, 
and titanium.
Likewise, Southern Africa is one of the world’s richest source of gold, diamond, 
and several other rare metals. Among the countries of the region, the republic of 
South Africa alone has the largest and most diverse mineral economy. As a result, 
the country is a leading producer of gold and uncut (raw) diamonds. Zimbabwe 
is also an important producer of gold. Botswana and Namibia produce significant 
amount of diamond. Chromium, cobalt, antimony, uranium, lithium, nickel, 
manganese, asbestos, platinum, titanium, and vanadium are also important 
minerals produced in southern Africa.

Minerals account for about half of the export earnings of 12 African countries. 
Nearly 90 percent of the exports in Angola, Nigeria, Algeria, Libya, and Zambia 
come form minerals. As a result, Africa plays a significant role in the world’s

Agricultural Resources
What are the major agricultural resources of Africa? Can you list some of the 
tropical crops that Africa is known for?
Agriculture is the backbone of many African countries. Apart from being the 
main source of foodstuffs and employment, the sector is a dominant source of 
agricultural outputs that enter into world market. Africa’s physical diversity has 
made the continent an ideal environment for the production of certain agricultural 
products that are vitally demanded in the world market. The continent is rich in 
terms of certain tropical crops such as coffee, cocoa, tea, sugarcane, rubber, palm 
oil, sisal, cotton and ground nuts. The economy of many African countries is 
primarily agricultural. They are dependent on the exportation of these tropical 
crops. Crop production absorbs much of the continent’s labour force; and the 
exportation of crops contributes a lot to the GDP of the exporting countries.

4.3 Natural Resources Of Africa And Its Politics
Water and Associated Resources
Do you think that different kinds of resources can be obtained from water 
bodies? Mention some examples.
Though the provision of clean water is a critical problem in many countries of 
Africa, the continent is still rich in terms of water resources. Thousands of rivers 
that altogether comprise the four major drainage systems of Africa flow over the 
vast landmass of the continent. The rivers that drain many areas of the continent 
include some of the world’s greatest rivers namely Nile, Congo, Niger and 
Zambezi. There are also many lakes, a lot of which are concentrated in the Great 
East African Rift Valley, a site also containing varied biodiversity. The rivers 
and lakes have tremendous potential in terms of fishing, hydroelectric power 
generation, irrigation, and mineral extraction. 
The rivers and lakes of Africa, as well as the adjacent seas and oceans make the 
continent rich in terms of fish resources. Major grounds for marine fish such as 
tuna, sardines, and hake are found some distance off from West African coasts 
stretching from Morocco to Senegal, and Angola to Namibia. The Nile, Niger, 
Congo, and Senegal rivers and Lakes Victoria, Tanganyika, Malawi, and Chad are 
also major sources of freshwater fish. Nile perch is the most common freshwater 
fish targeted in angling. 
Morocco, Egypt, South Africa, Ghana, and Nigeria were the top African countries 
in total fish catch in 1999. Morocco, Namibia, South Africa, Senegal, and Libya 
exported the most fish in the same period. Morocco is also leading in fishprocessing industries, producing more canned fish, fish oil, and fish meal than 
any other African country. 
Africa’s many large rivers provide the continent with a vast hydro electric power 
potential, Which, in fact, has scarcely been exploited. Several major dams including 
the Aswan High Dam on the Nile River, the Akosombo Dam on the Volta River, 
and the Kariba Dam and Cabora Bassa Dam on the Zambezi River have been 
constructed since 1960. In Ethiopia, the major rivers of the country mainly rivers 
Tekeze and Ghibe have already been dammed for this purpose. The country has 
also inaugurated a new dam construction project on the Abay river recently.
Irrigation is another potential to be exploited from Africa’s rivers and lakes. 
As these water bodies contain fresh water, they can potentially be exploited for 
agricultural purposes. As many areas in Africa are rainfall deficient, the rivers 
and lakes that form the drainage systems of the continent can be used for the 
production of agricultural products. For instance, the Nile River supports the 
lives of millions of people in Sudan and Egypt by providing irrigable water to 
Unit 4: Population, Economy and Natural Resources of Africa 243
4.3 Natural Resources Of Africa And Its Politics 4.3 Natural Resources Of Africa And Its Politics
these countries. Similarly, the Awash River in Ethiopia makes such a benefit 
available to the people of this country. There are many irrigation schemes along 
the Awash River basin including the Upper and Lower Awash agro-industries and 
the different sugar cane plantations in the region. However, the huge irrigation 
potential of many rivers and lakes in Africa is not yet fully exploited. Despite such 
available potential, decline in agricultural productivity is a common phenomenon 
in many African states. As a result, the continent often suffers from recurrent 
famine. 
Another most important stockpile associated with water resources in Africa 
is mineral. The shores and beds of lakes and banks of rivers are of substantial 
source of minerals. In many countries of the continent, construction materials 
such as sand, gravel and boulders are being exploited from rivers and lakes. 
Gold and other precious metals are also being extracted from rivers in traditional 
ways in many countries. For example, many people in Ethiopia extract gold from 
the Baro River in the Gambella Regional State. Similar traditional gold mining 
practices are also being performed in many African countries. 
Human Resources
Why do we say that Africa is rich in terms of human power?
Africa is the world’s second most populous continent. According to the 2009 
World Population Data Sheet, the continent is a home for about 1 billion people. 
Of this number 41% is under 15 and 3% above 65 years of age. The rest 56% is 
in the productive age. This makes the continent rich in terms of human resource 
potential. This indicates, firstly, the fact that about 56% of the total population 
is currently actively productive: and, secondly, the future potential of labour is 
relatively high since the 41% population of under 15 would soon join the labour 
force. Yet, we can say that the human resource potential of the continent has 
never been exploited to its full extent. In simple words, it fails to contribute to 
the development of the continent since much of the labour force, including the 
economically active, are unemployed or idle and even underemployed. 
4.3.2 Natural Resources Exploitation and 
Mineral Extraction Methods in Africa
How are resources being extracted in Africa? To what extent is Africa’s resource 
extraction sector developed?
As we have seen so far, Africa has tremendous potential of natural resources. 
However, the degree of exploitation of these resources of the continent appears 
Grade 11 Geography 244
4.3 Natural Resources Of Africa And Its Politics
being very low. This is partly due to the prevalent lack of good governance, 
corruption, maladministration and lack of citizens’ participation in resource 
development programs. In addition to this, lack of capital, skilled human power 
and technology have also contributed for the limited development of the resource 
exploitation sector in the continent. As a result, most resource extraction techniques 
are traditional in their nature. This in turn affects the level of productivity. Forest 
resources extraction, fishing, cultivation, and other sectors of the economy that 
are linked with natural resources are dominantly traditional in their nature.
The mining sector is also affected by these problems. As a result, the huge 
mineral potential of many African countries remains useless for most of them 
as it fails to guarantee the peoples’ development. This is due to the backward 
mining technology that most of the peoples in these countries follow. Mineral 
extraction in many African countries is traditional and less productive. The 
people near by mineral deposits utilize different traditional techniques to take 
different kinds of minerals out from the soil. Placer mining, strip mining and 
quarrying are among the most common mining methods in Africa. Placer Mining 
is the extraction of mineral deposits from excavations of sand, gravel, clay, or 
silt. Minerals mined in this way include gold, platinum, tin, and diamonds. Placer 
mining is most common among societies living near river valleys, where such 
minerals as mentioned above are brought to the surface by erosion. Strip Mining 
is uncovering and removing coal, metal, or a mineral that is near the surface of 
the ground. And quarrying is open excavation from which any useful stone is 
extracted for building and engineering purposes, and the operations required to 
obtain rock in useful form from a quarry. 
Some countries that are rich in natural resources, i.e. those that receive more 
than 25 percent of their government revenues from natural resources extraction, 
actually tend to have high and growing levels of poverty, extreme income 
inequalities, greater risk of conflict, and high levels of corruption. 
4.3.3 Resource Utilization and Conflict 
Management
As has been elaborated in preceding discussions, Africa is naturally endowed 
with varied resources that could potentially contribute a lot to the continent’s 
development. However, the degree of exploitation of these resources is practically 
insignificant. The huge mineral potential of the continent is untouched. The 
Unit 4: Population, Economy and Natural Resources of Africa 245
4.3 Natural Resources Of Africa And Its Politics 4.3 Natural Resources Of Africa And Its Politics
water resources are untapped. Even in areas where the extraction of minerals 
is better developed, the resource is becoming more of a cause of conflict than 
of a socio-economic development. As you might have heard from different 
sources of information, Africa is the only continent that is well characterized 
by political unrest, conflicts, civil war and related humanitarian crisis including 
huge displacement of people. As a matter of fact, the continent is considered as 
the world’s largest refugee camp since millions of Africans live in refugee camps 
as a result of displacement for reasons of conflicts and civil war. 
Activity 4.14
1 Do you know any African country where resource utilization is a cause of 
conflict and civil war? If yes, identify the countries and discuss what causes the 
conflict or the civil war.
2 Have you ever seen or heard of a conflict caused by resource exploitation, such 
as land utilization, for grazing in your area? If yes, how did the people solve 
their problem (if at all they have solved it)?
3 What, do you think, should be done to manage conflicts that arise from resource 
utilization at local and or continental level?
The major source of conflict in many resource exploitation areas of Africa is 
related to inappropriate use and allocation of resources. If we consider many of 
the conflicts and civil wars in Africa, their causes are deep rooted in resource 
allocation and utilization. In most of the cases, governments fail to provide better 
opportunities for the residents of the areas where resources, especially minerals, 
are being exploited. To add fuel to the problem, many governments do not even 
make the inhabitants of resource extraction areas beneficiaries of the exploited 
resources. Thus, while many Africans live in extreme poverty expensive resources 
get tapped and exported to rich countries. This causes conflict. In demand of having 
their opportunities fulfilled, peoples of such areas confront their governments. 
When the government fail to properly address the issue, the conflict intensifies 
and people die ultimately, the case worsens and civil war occurs. 
The conflicts that have made Africa an extensive battle field of civil wars are in 
one way or another associated with unfair utilization and allocation of resources. 
The Civil wars in Southern Sudan, Liberia, Democratic republic of Congo, 
Angola, and Rwanda are fought because of inappropriate resource utilization and 
allocation, besides seeking political power.

Activity 4.15
1 Have you ever heard about the issue of “blood diamond” in Liberia? What is it 
supposed to mean?
2 What are the causes of the civil wars in Angola and the Democratic Republic of 
Congo?
Civil war is the exception rather than the rule across much of the developing 
world. The combination of weak governance structures and resources that offer 
the promise of windfall gains to those who control production and export is the 
major cause of violent conflict. In the post–cold-war era, revenues from natural 
resources have replaced superpower funding as the fuel of war. Between 1990 
and 2002, the world saw at least 17 such conflicts in which wealth from natural 
resource was a primary factor. Diamonds in Angola and Sierra Leone, timber and 
diamonds in Liberia, gems in Afghanistan, and copper, gold, cobalt and timber in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo have all been at the centre of civil conflict. 
In the case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, such a cause of conflict has 
been accompanied by incursions supported by neighboring states.
In this manner, financial flows that could have been used to support human 
development have frequently been diverted into funding civil wars, with 
governments, rebels and assorted warlords seeking control over oil, metals, 
minerals and timber. The wealth from the second largest oil reserves in Africa 
(Angola) and the fourth largest diamond reserves in the world was used to fuel a 
civil war that killed and wounded nearly 1 million people and left other 4 million 
internally displaced between 1975 and 2002. Today, Angola ranks 160 among 
177 countries on the Human Development Index (HDI), with a life expectancy 
of about 40 years only. The following table gives you a highlight on the duration 
and causes of civil conflicts in selected countries of Africa.

Unit Review
 UNIT SUMMARY 
Þ Africa and other developing regions make up an increasing share of world 
population. The world population has shown a tremendous increment 
from 1950 to 2000. Africa, Asia and Latin America contribute the highest 
proportion to this share.
Þ According to the 2050 world population projection a high population 
concentration shifts to developing countries. 
Þ The projections suggest that the share for developed countries declines 
from 18 percent in 2008 to less than 14 percent in 2050. 
Þ The growth rate of population is a vital demographic feature that can help 
us understand the population change that a given society has undergone 
and will undertake in the future.
Þ Africa is the only continent whose population is growing faster than any 
other continents on earth. 
Þ There is not an even distribution of population in the world. Deductively, 
Africa’s population distribution is uneven. 
Þ The unevenness of African population distribution is attributable to human 
and physical factors. 
Þ The three major components that bring about a change in matters related 
to population in any country are fertility, mortality and migration. 
Þ Africa’s rapid population growth and backward Socio-economic 
development have turned Africa into the world’s lowest social amenities. 
As a result, poor health, inadequate education, deficient nutrition and 
inferior housing facility widely tangle the people of the continent. 
Þ Africa’s rate of urbanization is the highest in the world. 
Þ Currently, the uncontrolled and rapid urbanization has depopulated 
the rural areas. This has crippled agricultural production, especially the 
production of food crops. 
Þ Generally speaking, rapid urban growth has become a major cause of 
growing poverty both in rural and urban areas in Africa. 
Grade 11 Geography 248
Unit Review
Þ The term Economic Growth is used to describe the increase in the total 
amount of production and wealth in the economy of a given society.
Þ Economic development refers to growth with structural and technological 
change. It includes the concept of overall transformation in the living 
condition of the people of society.
Þ The level of developed of a certain economy is directly linked with three 
most important conditions that are generally considered as major indicators 
of development. These are the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Per capita 
income (GNP per capita) and Standard of living of a certain population.
Þ High GDP, Per capita Income and standard of living indicate higher level 
of development. The reverse indicates under development.
Þ Low GDP, low income per head, poor and inadequate housing conditions, 
poor transport and communication networks, low educational and health 
coverage, widely spread unemployment, high mortality rates of all sorts, 
high human fertility and indecent life characterize the living conditions of 
millions of peoples in Africa.
Þ Africa is generally considered as a continent with untouched natural 
resources. However, the continent fails to fully exploiting its resources.
Þ Dependency on agriculture, low level of industrialization, poor inter- and 
intra-regional trade performance, poor transport and communication 
network, low GDP and per capita income characterize Africa’s economy.
Þ Lack of capital, skilled human power and modern technology; rapid 
population growth, HIV/AIDS and other factors are among the challenges 
that affect Africa’s development.
Þ Many African countries have extremely high foreign debt.
Þ The different continental and regional organizations in Africa are believed 
to be motors of change in Africa’s socio-economic condition.
Þ Africa is rich in terms of natural and human resources. However, the degree 
of exploitation of these resources is found to be very low. As a result, what 
the people of Africa benefit from the immense resources of their continent 
appears being insignificant.
Þ In most of the cases, places of mineral extraction are areas of violence, 
conflict and civil war. There have been many conflicts among Africans 
that were caused by mining related factors.
