used for many purposes, and are especially effective devices for recording and 
communicating information about our environment. This unit focuses on maps 
that present physical features of the world. You will learn how to read maps that
F Show where places and things are located 
F Indicate heights and depths of features on the earth
What do we need to know in order to use maps?
To use maps effectively, you must be able to read them easily. In other words, 
you must be map-‘literate.’ This unit will teach you many skills you need to read 
maps. 
For example, you will learn how to use the following information that maps 
present: 
F Location
F Distance and direction between locations 
F Relief (elevation), which indicates the third dimension on a twodimensional plane
As you learn to read maps, you will also learn more about scale. As you learned in 
Grade 9, scale is the ratio between distance or area on a map and the corresponding 
measurements on the surface of the earth. 
You will also learn how to reduce and enlarge maps accurately.

1.1.1 Identification of Direction 
How do we identify direction? Do you know places in your locality that got their 
names from winds? Do you know some local expressions related to direction? 
The science of direction goes back to human’s earliest observations of nature, 
especially stars and winds. For example, imagine an Ethiopian farmer of those 
days waiting for a wind to blow off the fine chaff of grains during harvesting. The 
farmer looked in the direction from which he or she hoped the wind would come. 
When the wind came, the farmer gratefully named it after its source, like ‘ye Dega 
Nefas’, ‘ye Kola Nefas’ etc.
Sometimes place names are associated with winds. For example the provincial 
capital city of Gayent in southern Gonder is known as ‘Nefas Mewicha’ or Source 
of Wind.
Landmarks are important aids to people who are travelling in a new environment. 
A landmark is an object that is easily seen from a distance. We use landmarks to 
help us remember where things are, and we try to remember their appearance and 
locations in order to avoid getting lost. 
When we travel in familiar surroundings, we often relate to landmarks without 
being aware that we are doing so. But when we are in a new or not well- known 
area, we make a conscious effort to notice them. We might also use tools such as 
maps and compasses to help us find our way around.
Many of us are familiar with the four cardinal points of the compass–North, East, 
South and West. There are thirty-two points of the compass, but only sixteen are 
used to describe direction. The points midway between the cardinal points are 
known as North-East (NE), South-East (SE), etc. The others, North-North-East 
(NNE), East-North-East (ENE), etc. relate to further sub-divisions.
Grade 10 Geography 4
1.1 Direction On Maps
Compasses are marked with degrees as well as with the direction points we 
described earlier. As shown in Figure 1.1, the degrees start at the north from 0°, 
and increase in the clockwise direction. The direction points coincide with degree 
points. For example, 0° coincides with N, and 180° coincides with S. You can 
express direction more precisely in degrees than in direction points.

1.1.2 Measurement of Direction and 
Bearing
How do we measure direction and bearing?
In order to determine directions from one place to another out in the field or on 
a map, we must first select or identify one direction from which we can identify 
and measure other directions. This basic direction we call the cardinal direction. 
The cardinal direction could be anyone but at present, internationally, we use 
North as the cardinal direction and measure all other bearings from this one. 
When printing a map we usually arrange the cardinal direction so that it points to 
the top of the map. Before doing any measurements of directions, make sure that 
you know where true north is. 
Directions from one point to another or the bearing of one point from another can 
be given using two different sets of units. The traditional system uses the cardinal 
compass points north, east, south, west and subdivisions of them. A modern, and 
more accurate, method gives the directions in degrees and fractions of degrees 
clockwise from north. The relationship between the two ways of giving directions 
is shown in Figure 1.1.
Figure 1.2 shows you how to determine directions and bearings on maps. 
The procedure involves the following steps. 
Example: 
To find the direction from point A to point B on the map Figure 1.2. 
1 Draw a line with a pencil joining points A and B on the map. 
2 Through the point from which the bearing is required draw a pencil 
line parallel to true north as indicated by the meridians or the arrow 
indicating true north. 
3 Using these two lines, set your protractor so that its centre is in point 
A and measure the angle between the true north line and the line A - B 
reading clock wise from north = 0o
. 
4 State the bearing either in compass directions or degrees clockwise 
from north. 
Grade 10 Geography 6
1.1 Direction On Maps
Answer:
i The direction from A to B is 135o
 or point B bears 135o
 from A. 
ii Point B is roughly South East of A or point B bears South East from A. 
Figure 1.2: The Measurement of directions 
The direction of a line from one point to another can be given in terms of compass 
direction. In Figure 1.3, for example, B lies north-east of A, and conversely A lies 
south-west of B.
Figure 1.3: Compass directions 
We may also describe wind direction in terms of compass direction. Look at 
Figure 1.4. B lies north-east of A. Therefore a wind blowing from B to A is called 
a north-east wind. Note carefully that wind direction is named after the direction 
from which the wind blows.

A direction indicated in degrees is called a bearing. The bearing of an object 
refers to its direction and a clockwise measurement in degrees from the zero line 
(0° or N), which is the north direction.
 
 a) Bearing of B from A is 60o b) Bearing of C from A is 300o
 Bearing of A from B is 240o Bearing of A from C is 120o
Figure 1.5: Forward and back bearings
In Figure 1.5, the bearing of B from A is 60°, which is angle NAB. The bearing of 
C from A is 300°, which is reflex angle NAC. Note that the bearing of C from A is 
not the smaller acute angle NAC, since bearings are always measured clockwise 
from north. 
The directions of A from B and from C, respectively, are called back bearings. 
A back bearing is obtained by adding or subtracting 180° to or from a forward 
bearing.

How do we know the exact position of a place on the earth’s surface?
The position of places on the earth’s surface and upon maps can be given in a 
number of different ways. The most important are through the use of:
F Latitude and longitude (international grid references)
F National Grid References (eastings and northings) 
1.2.1 Position by the Geographic Grid
Why do we prefer to use geographic grid system to locate the position of a place 
on a map?
This is a method by which the position of a place can be given accurately with 
the help of a grid composed of a network of lines known as parallels and the 
meridians. 
If you study a globe carefully you will find that two sets of lines form a network 
on the surface of it. One set of lines run from the North pole to the South pole. 
These lines are known as Merdians. 
Grade 10 Geography 10
1.2 Position On Maps
The other set of lines are running around the globe parallel to the equator. They 
are known as parallels. 
Using this grid we can now give the accurate position of any place on the earth’s 
surface. The parallels give the position in degrees, minutes and seconds north or 
south of the equator. This is the Latitude of the place. The other set of lines, the 
meridians, give the position of the point in degrees, minutes and seconds to the 
east or west of the zero degree meridian. This is the longitude of the place. 
Focus
On the huge earth-globe, a net of lines only 1o
 apart would be far too open 
a mesh (the spaces of a certain size in a network) for particular use. Some 
spaces would be as large as 100 kilometers each way. And in navigation 
the position of an airplane must be precise to the fraction of kilometers. 
For that reason the degree is divided by 60. Each of these 60ths is a minute. 
(symbol:’). Not a clock-minute: “minute” also means “little”. Even this 
little is not small enough for scientific locating. We must divide the degree 
a second time, and each of these divisions is a second. (Symbol:”) A 
second is a 60th of a minute. That makes a network of so small a mesh 
with which to cover the earth that no place can slip through. 
Study the following diagram in Figure 1.7
Latitude: The latitude of point p on the 
surface of the earth is equal to the angle 
between the radius through the point and 
equatorial plane. (i.e., the plane limited 
by the equator.) 
Longitude: The longitude of point p on 
the surface of the earth is equal to the 
angle between the radius through the 
point and the 0o
 and 180o
 plane. (i.e., the 
plane limited by the zero meridian and 
the 180o
 meridian.)

Therefore, the geographic grid of point P is 45o
N, 90o
W 
Latitude and longitude sometimes are confused with two other terms: parallel 
and Meridian. 
Parallel: an imaginary line joining all points with the same latitude. 
Meridian: An imaginary line joining all points with the same longitude. 
Note that the first set of terms (latitude and longitude) deal with angles the 
second set (Parallel and Meridians) with lines.

1.2.2 National Grid Reference System
What is a National Grid system? How can a national grid system help us to 
identify the position of a place on a map?
A National grid is a network of horizontal and vertical lines printed on the face of 
a map. The network of grid lines border squares. These squares may be divided 
into smaller and smaller squares.
The size of a map’s grid squares depends on the scale of the map. For example, 
the sides of the squares on a large-scale or medium-scale national or regional 
Grade 10 Geography 14
1.2 Position On Maps
topographic map might represent 100 km, 10 km or 1 km. Each line is given a 
number. This numbering begins at a particular point. This point is the southwestern corner of the whole grid for the country and it is called the grid origin or 
the National grid origin. 
F The grid origin of Ethiopia lies in south-west most corner, is at the point 
in SW Kenya where the 34o
30'E meridian crosses the equator (0o
). (See 
Figure 1.9). 
F Such a grid system provides the position of any point, in kilometers and 
fractions of kilometers east and north of the grid origin. 
F From the origin, all vertical lines are numbered eastwards. They are 
called eastings.
F All horizontal lines are numbered northwards. They are called northings.
F In contrast to meridians, eastings (verticals) do not indicate true north.

The grid origin of Ethiopia is located at a point where the 34°30'E meridian

reference in the margin of the map. Then draw perpendiculars from these points 
as shown on Figure 1.11. Where the two lines cross one another you will have the 
point you are looking for. 
The accuracy obtained with six figure grid reference as far as position is concerned 
is to the nearest 100 meters. This accuracy is made possible by the larger scale of 
the map. The actual difference between a four figure and six figure grid reference 
is therefore one of accuracy. Four figure grid reference should therefore be used 
only in connection with maps that have a scale so small that it is impossible to get 
a greater accuracy than to the nearest kilometer. 
Remember always that a grid reference NEVER can be used to indicate an area. 
The reference always stands for a POINT, that is the intersection of two lines.

Why do we enlarge a map?
We enlarge and reduce maps for different reasons.
Enlargement: We enlarge a map when we need to show more details (features) 
about the area it shows. Often, enlarged maps are produced in order to support 
detailed study of the area that the map presents. 
We enlarge a map by enlarging its scale. The size of the paper on which the new 
map is printed increases in proportion to the new scale. 
Example:
K city maps are often enlarged maps. 
K An enlarged map would be quite helpful for demonstrating the 
required area for a class room. 
Why do we reduce a map?
Reduction: We reduce maps when we need to be selective and to generalize the 
information that the map presents. 
When the scale of the map decreases, the size of the map also decreases 
accordingly. 
When you enlarge or reduce a map, consider these principles: if a map is to be 
enlarged x times, the new map will be x times the scale of the old map. If you 
reduce a map by 1/x, the scale of the new map will be 1/x times the scale of the 
old map. 
Unit 1: Map Reading 19
1.3 Map Enlargement And Reduction 1.3 Map Enlargement And Reduction
Example 1
If we enlarge a map with a scale 1:200,000 two times, what will be the scale 
of the new map?
Solution: 
Previous scale = 1: 200,000 or 1/200,000
The scale of the new map = 1/200,000 × 2 = 1/100,000 or 1:100,000
The scale of the new map (1:100, 000) is two times larger than the scale 
of the old map, (1: 200,000)
Example 2
If we reduce a map with a scale 1:50,000 by half, what will be the scale 
of the new map?
Solution: 
Previous scale = 1:50,000 
The scale of the new map = 1/50,000 × 1/2 = 1/100,000 or 1:100,000
The scale of the new map (1:100,000) is half of the scale of the old map 
(1:50,000).
The amount of increase or reduction of scale can be obtained by applying the 
following formulae:
1 Amount of enlargement =
The denominator of the small scale
The denominator of the large scale
Example 3
A map at 1: 200,000 is to be enlarged to a map at 1:100,000. By how 
many times is the scale increased?
Amount of increase = 200,000/100,000 = 2 times
2 The amount of reduction = Denominator of large scale
Denominator of small scale
Example 4 
A map with a scale of 1: 50,000 is reduced to 1:1000,000. How many 
times is the scale reduced? 
Amount of reduction = 50,000/100,000 = 1/2 times

On the basis of the given scale, you can enlarge or reduce the map by drawing as 
many squares as needed. The squares should cover the whole map. 
For illustration refer to Figure 1.13. 
Exercise: Increase the map scale 1:20,000,000 twice. 
The steps involved are the following: 
1 Find the size of the original map through measurement and make up your 
mind about how big you want your new map to be. This will give you the 
scale of the new map that you want to construct. 
Unit 1: Map Reading 21
1.3 Map Enlargement And Reduction 1.3 Map Enlargement And Reduction
2 Draw the frame of your map to be in such a way that the sides are double 
as long as the sides of the original map. 
3 Cover the original map with a grid of half centimetre by half centimetre 
squares. 
4 Cover your map under construction with a similar grid now using one 
centimetre by one centimeter squares. 
5 In order to cross check the squares on both maps, write numbers on the 
horizontal margin and alphabets on the vertical margin. 
6 Using the grid as a guide, trace the major features that you want to show on 
your enlarged map carefully in pencil. 
7 Finalize your map using color pencils for the different features that you 
wanted to show, then remove the grid lines from both maps. 
This method of enlargement, or reduction, of scale can be used for any kind of 
drawing and the result is relatively accurate if your measurements and tracings are 
carefully done. 
Note: that the scale for your map is arrived at multiplying the old scale with the 
number of times that you have increased the original scale or diving the original 
scale with the number of times that you have decreased that scale. 
Note also that when you reduce the scale you usually have to leave out certain details 
present on the original map.

1 Following the above method, enlarge the map of Ethiopia (Figure 1.13) Convert 
the current scale of 1: 20,000,000 into a new scale of 1:10,000,000 in order to 
create the new map. 
2 Following the above procedure, reduce the map in Figure 1.13 by half of its size.
NB: Do not write or mark on the book. Trace the map on a separate sheet of paper. 
B Using the Pantograph Method
A pantograph is a mechanical device used for reproducing maps, drawings etc. 
at the same or different scales. Maps that are enlarged or reduced using the 
pantograph are more accurate than ones done using the square method.
A pantograph is made of four pieces of wood, metal or plastic.
A pantograph has three operational points: the pivot, (noted as marked in red) 
the tracer and the pencil holder (marked in blue). The pivot is fixed on the table.
‘Panto’ means ‘all’ or ‘every’. The device works in combination of all its parts.

Unit 1: Map Reading 23
1.3 Map Enlargement And Reduction 1.4 Relief On Maps
Procedure: 
1 Arrange the pantograph either to do enlargement or reduction. the 
arrangement in Figure 1.14 is for enlargement. 
2 Fix the map to be enlarged (original) at red point (traces). Fix a clean 
paper at the location of the “Pen”. 
3 Then, when you start tracing on the original map with a tracer at the red 
point, the pen starts drawing on the paper at the location of the “pen”. 
The drawing will appear larger. 
4 To do reduction you have to reverse the position of the tracer and the 
pen. The original map should be fixed at the position of the “Pen” and 
the new map to be drawn at the position of red point.

What do you understand by the term relief? 
What kinds of landforms are found in your locality? 
Relief refers to the difference in altitude between the highest and lowest points 
in an area or surface structure of any part of the earth. It relates to land features 
like plains, hills, plateaus, valleys, ridges, etc. These relief features have three 
dimensions (length, breadth and height), but a map on which they are represented 
has only two dimensions, (length and breadth). 
1.4.1 Methods of Showing Relief on a Map 
How can we represent relief on maps? 
In order to read relief features from maps, you should first know how map -makers 
represent the uneven surface of the earth on a plane sheet of paper, i.e., on a map. 
There are different ways of showing relief on maps. These include: 
F Physiographic diagrams 
F Hachures 
F Layer coloring 
F Hill shading 
F Form lines 
F Contour 
Unit 1: Map Reading 25
1.4 Relief On Maps 1.4 Relief On Maps
Traditional Methods
A Physiographic Diagrams 
What is a physiographic diagram? 
Early map makers used to represent relief features by diagrammatic pictures 
known as physiographic diagrams. They show three-dimensional pictures of 
landscapes as viewed from the side or oblique direction (see Figure 1.15). 
This method of showing relief is simple and easy to understand. However, it has the 
following disadvantages: 
F It shows the side and oblique view of the landscape, unlike the modern 
relief map that gives you an overhead view of an area. 
F Some geographic details of an area would be hidden from view behind 
the “backs” of the pictures of hills or mountains. 
F Exact heights and slopes of the land forms are not indicated. 
F It lacks accuracy because it is drawn without scale. 
Figure 1.15: Physiographic diagram
Grade 10 Geography 26
1.4 Relief On Maps
Activity 1.8
1 Carefully look at the physiographic drawings on Figure 1.15. 
a In which direction are the shadows of hills cast? 
b What is the direction of illumination (sunshine)? 
2 With the help of a physiographic diagram, draw a sketch map representing 
the major landforms of your locality and evaluate its shortcomings with your 
friends in the class. 
B Hachures 
What are hachures? 
Hachures are short disconnected lines that represent slopes. For example,
Figure 1.16. They are drawn in the direction in which water flows. Originally 
they were used to represent mountains and valleys on simple sketch maps. 
Basically, hachures show the steepness of slopes. When slopes are steep, hachures 
are put close together. For gentle slopes, the hachures are spaced wide apart. In 
addition, hachures representing steep slopes are shorter than those representing 
gentle slopes. 
Can you describe the major relief features represented in Figure 1.16?
Figure 1.16: Hachured map 
Unit 1: Map Reading 27
1.4 Relief On Maps 1.4 Relief On Maps
This approach has significant limitations, such as:
F Flat areas are unshaded. Therefore, plateaus and plains can be confused. 
F Hachures do not indicate height and exact gradients. They give only 
qualitative information. 
F Hachures are laborious to draw and can be difficult to read and 
interpret. 
Nowadays, hachures are not used alone. Instead, they are used in combination 
with contour lines to show landforms like escarpments, depressions and craters. 
(contour lines are described in a later section of this unit). 
Activity 1.9
Study Figure 1.16 and then briefly describe how hachures differ from and are superior 
to physiographic diagrams for representing relief.
C Hill shading
What is hill shading? What are some of the limitations of hill shading? 
Hill shading is also known as oblique illumination. It is a method of showing 
relief on a map, assuming an oblique light that illuminates the landscape from 
the northwest corner of the map. Hence the northwest-facing slopes are shaded 
lighter than are the east-facing and south-facing slopes. The steeper the slope is, 
the darker it is shaded. 
Hill shading offers a quick general impression of the land configuration that it 
represents. But still it has some limitations such as: 
F It does not give absolute altitude. 
F It fails to indicate clearly whether the ground is sloping upward or 
downward. 
F It fails to indicate whether the unshaded areas are low or high-level 
areas. Hence, plateaus and plains can be confused. 
F Detailed map information can be obscured by shading. 
In general, hill shading is now used in combination with spot heights and contours 
to overcome some of its drawbacks.

Compare Figure 1.16 and Figure 1.17. What improvements do you see in Figure 1.17? 
Discuss your observations with your classmates or friends. 
D Layer Coloring (Layer Tinting)
What is layer coloring? 
It is a method of showing relief by using colors. The series of colors for showing 
different altitudes starts from sea level (see Figure 1.18). 
Identify the types of colors used to represent the different elevation zones in 
Figure 1.18. 
Lake Tana
Mt. Guna
Figure 1.17: Hill shading on a map of Northwestern Ethiopia
Unit 1: Map Reading 29
1.4 Relief On Maps 1.4 Relief On Maps
Layer coloring has the following disadvantages:
F Color shading does not indicate gradual changes in slopes. 
F The edges of the areas of different colors can suggest nonexistent 
physical boundaries.
F Dark colors can obscure details in the areas that they overlie.
F Some colors can create false impressions in the map reader’s mind. For 
example, green might suggest vegetation or a fertile area.
Activity 1.11
By referring to the Ethiopian Atlas from your library, describe to the class how layer 
coloring is used to identify different altitudinal zones in Ethiopia. If possible try to cite 
some of the names of specific areas in each elevation zone. 
E Formlines
What are formlines? 
A formline is imaginary pecked or broken line joining points with the same 
approximate height on a map. Usually they are drawn on topographic maps to 
show where survey work is incomplete or poorly accomplished. Also, these lines 
are useful for showing sea depths.

1.4 Relief On Maps
What are the limitations of formlines? 
Formlines have the following limitations:
F They are not drawn on a map at a fixed interval of altitude.
F Although they represent the relief of an area, they provide little or no 
reference to sea level. 
F In many cases they are unnumbered. 
F They are usually drawn with broken lines.
Activity 1.12
Discuss the following in your group and present the result of your discussion to the 
class. 
1 Briefly describe some of the common problems of traditional methods of 
showing relief on maps. 
2 Some of the traditional methods are still being used in combination with contour 
lines in order to show some landforms. Mention some of their current uses. 
Modern Methods 
F Contour Lines or Isohypses 
What are contour lines? How do contour lines differ from traditional methods 
of showing relief on maps? 
Contour lines are the most common and accurate way of showing relief on 
modern maps. A shoreline is a good example of a contour line. 
Focus 
Contour lines are lines drawn on a map joining places of the same 
elevation above mean sea level. They give almost true altitudes. They 
also indicate different slopes and land forms. 
How are contour lines drawn? 
The drawing of contour lines is illustrated in the diagram below. Study it carefully. 
Unit 1: Map Reading 31
1.4 Relief On Maps 1.4 Relief On Maps
 a) Side view of a hill b) Top view of the same hill
 
As indicated in Figure 1.19, a contour line joins all points on the hill that are at the 
same height. For example, contour line 150 m passes through points A and B, while 
contour line 250 m runs through points C and D. All of the points on contour line 
150 m are 150 m high and those on the 250 m line are all 250 m high. 
To give clearer impressions of the relief on contour maps, contour lines are 
sometimes used in combination with hachures, hill-shading, layer-coloring and 
spot heights. 
Properties of Contour Lines
What are the main properties of contour lines? Why are contour lines more 
accurate than the traditional methods of showing relief on maps? 
General properties of contour lines. 
Here are some important points about contour lines: 
i Contour lines are imaginary lines used on a map to represent relief. Unlike 
the lines that represent rivers, boundaries or coast lines, contours do not 
really exist on the earth’s surface. The only contour line that exists both on 
the map and in the field is the sea level.
Focus
Mean sea level (m.s.l.) is the average level of the sea, as calculated from a 
large number of observations taken at equal intervals of time. It is the most 
common standard level from which all heights are measured.

1.4 Relief On Maps
ii A set of contour lines is drawn at a fixed height interval. For example in the 
Figure 1.19, contour lines are drawn at 50-meter intervals. The difference in 
altitude between two successive contour lines is known as vertical interval
(V. I.) or contour interval (C. I.). The V. I. helps us to find out the heights of 
unnumbered contour lines. 
iii Contour lines cannot merge or cross one another on maps except at vertical 
cliffs, waterfalls or over hanging cliffs.
For example, two or more contour lines run together and then separate to 
represent the cliff shown in the figure below.
 
The cliff in the preceding diagram is a vertical mountain wall. It rises from 
100 meters to 150 meters. 
The crossing of contours occurs only in the case of an overhanging cliff. 
Usually contours representing a cave under an overhanging cliff are shown 
with pecked lines.
 a) On map b) In section 
iv Contour lines never branch. If you see branching lines on a map, they 
represent features such as rivers, roads, boundaries, etc. 
v A contour line joins all points of the same altitude. For example, an altitude of 
250 m will be on the 250 m contour line. The altitude of any point outside this 
line will be either greater or less than 250 meters (see Figure 1.22).

What are the heights of points P, Q and M on the above figure? 
vi Contour lines are always numbered in the direction towards which altitude 
increases. These numbers can be shown with or without breaking contour 
lines (see Figure 1.23). 
a) With breaking b) Without breaking
vii Contour lines indicate the nature of slopes. When contour lines are far 
apart, they show gentle slopes. But when contour lines are close together, 
they show steep slopes (See Figure 1.24). 
viii Contour lines can be printed with different thicknesses on a map. This 
is especially helpful in mountainous areas where altitudes may vary 
considerably from summits to valley floors. In order to make the reading 
of contour maps easier, every fifth or tenth contour line is printed thicker 
than the rest. Such contour lines are called index contour lines, while the 
rest are called regular contour lines.

etc. Many of these relief features are readily recognized from the shapes of 
their contour lines.

G Different Methods of Showing Altitudes on Contour Maps
What are the shortcomings of contour lines? 
How do you indicate the specific heights of hilltops, roads, railways, and towns? 
Contour lines show altitude and relief on modern maps. However, they do not 
show the specific heights of individual features such as mountain peaks, hilltops, 
valley floors, towers, towns, roads or railways. Such heights are indicated on 
maps, using the following methods: 
a Spot heights
F They are marked on the map with a dot followed by an altitude number:
Example:
K • 1940 meter (see Figure 1.27). 
F They provide accurate altitudes for individual points, such as those 
along a road, on a mountain top, or between contour lines. 
F Unlike contour lines, spot heights do not give a good visual impression 
of the general relief.
F They exist only on maps. 
b Trigonometrical points
F They exist both on maps and in the field. 
F They mostly mark features such as hilltops and mountain peaks.
K On the ground, the relevant feature is permanently marked with a 
pillar (concrete). 
K On maps, they are shown with a small triangle enclosing a dot, 
followed by the exact altitude in meters (see Figure 1.27). 
Example: 
The top of Mt. Ras Dashen can be shown as • 4620 meters on a 
topographic map. Mt. Gunna is • 4165 meters (see Figure 1.27) 
c Benchmarks
F They indicate precise heights along highways or railways. 
F They are shown on stones, bricks or bronze plates on walls of buildings 
and other convenient places. 
Unit 1: Map Reading 37
1.4 Relief On Maps 1.4 Relief On Maps
F They are useful for road construction engineers and others who wish to 
know the precise altitude of a main transport network.
Example:
• BM 1850 (where the point is marked on the ground, the height 
above mean sea level is 1850 meters).
d Calculating Altitude:
When the altitude of a point on a contour map is not shown by any of 
the above methods, it can be obtained by measurement and calculation, 
using the interpolation method. This can be done only if the given point is 
located between two contour lines. In order to find the altitude of point A in 
Figure 1.28, follow the procedures given below.
i Draw the shortest possible straight line that passes through point (A) 
and join the two contour lines adjacent to it. 
ii Measure the length of this line: = 11 mm.
iii Measure the distance on the map between the lower and upper 
contours up to point (A). They are 6 mm and 5 mm respectively. 
iv Find the vertical interval between the two contour lines: = 100 m.
v Then determine the altitude of the point using the following formula:
1 2 d
or
VI d VI
HC
D D
Altitude (A) LC  × ×    = +   −       
Where: d1
 is distance of point A from the lower contour,
d2
 is distance of point A from the upper contour,
D is distance between the upper and lower contours,
VI is vertical interval,
LC is the lower contour and,
HC is the higher contour.
 Altitude of point 
6 100 A 700 754.55 meters, 11
  ×
= +   =  
 or,
 Altitude of point 5 100 A 800 754.55 meters
11
  × = −   =  
Therefore, the altitude of point A is 754.55 meters.

1.4.2 Slopes and Gradients
A Slopes on Contour Maps
What is slope? How can we determine the steepness of slopes on contour maps?
What kind of relations exist between V.I. and slope? 
Slope is the upward or downward inclination of a natural or artificial surface. It is a 
deviation of the surface from the horizontal. 
On a map, steepness of a slope depends on:
F The distance between the contours drawn on the map. The closer the 
contours are, the steeper is the slope representation and vice versa (see 
Figure 1.24).

F The vertical interval (V.I.) between two successive contours. The bigger 
the V.I, the steeper is the slope representation and vice versa.
Types of Slopes 
How many types of slope do you know? Mention some of them and describe 
how you can identify them from contour maps. 
There are different types of slopes, which include:
i Even slope
An even slope has a constant gradient from the bottom to the top. Gradient is the 
degree or rate of a slope. You will learn more about gradient later in this unit. 
On a map of an even slope, the contour lines are evenly spaced throughout. For 
example, study the slope represented in Figure 1.29.
 a) in contour map b) in section 
ii Concave Slope
In a concave slope; the contour lines are widely spaced at the base and are close 
together at the top. In other words, a concave slope has a steep gradient at the top. 
The gradient becomes gentler towards the bottom (see Figure 1.30).

iii Convex Slope
In a convex slope, the contour lines are close together at the base and widely 
spaced at the top. The slope has a steep gradient at the bottom that becomes 
gentler towards the top. (See Figure 1.31).
 a) in contour map b) in section 
iv Terraced or Stepped Slope
In a terraced or stepped slope, the contour lines are alternatively close together 
and far apart in a regular pattern. This means the gradient changes several times 
between the bottom and the top of the slope (see Figure 1.32).
 
 a) in contour map b) in section
v Escarpment
An escarpment is the steep slope of a plateau, especially one where the plateau ends 
and the lowland starts. You can also identify other two more slopes on either side 
of a mountain ridge. One slope is steep and the other is gentle. The steep slope is 
called the scarp slope. The gentler slope is called the dip slope (see Figure 1.33).

What is gradient? What are the three common ways of expressing gradient? 
How do you determine the rate of change of slope between two points? 
Gradient (GR) is the degree or rate of change of slope or elevation between two 
points. 
It is calculated using altitude difference (vertical distance) and map distance 
(horizontal distance) between two points. Both AD and MD must be in the same 
unit of measurement. 
It can be expressed in any of these three different ways:
1 As a simple ratio: 
AD GR = MD

Where: GR = gradient, AD = altitude difference,
 MD = map distance.
Usually we express gradient as a percentage. This expression is the simplest to 
use, and it is relatively easy to calculate. 
Activity 1.16
Calculate the following: 
The distance on the map between Addis Ababa and Adama is about 10 cm with the 
scale of 1: 1,000,000 on a certain map of Ethiopia . The average elevations of the two 
are about 2400 and 1700 meters, respectively. Determine the gradient in ratio, in 
percent and in degree. 
Here are some examples of the three methods:
a Ratio: This expression of gradient gives a relationship between the vertical 
and horizontal dimensions of the slope.
Example:
The gradient ratio 1:20 means there is 1 unit of rise of altitude for 
every 20 units of horizontal distance.
b Percent: We use the ratio expression of gradient to obtain the expression as 
a percent. Multiply the ratio by 100.
Example:
1
20 × 100 = 5%. In other words, on average, there is a vertical rise 
of 5 units for every 100 units of horizontal distance.
c Degree: We also use the ratio expression to obtain the expression as a 
degree. Multiply the ratio by 60o
.

different expressions:

1.4.3 Field Distances (FD)
Do you remember how to find or calculate the different types of distances on a 
map? 
In any map exercise, you may need to find three different types of distances. 
Straight line distance, bending distance and field distance. Here we consider field 
distance.
Unit 1: Map Reading 45
1.4 Relief On Maps 1.4 Relief On Maps
What is field distance?
Field distance is the actual distance, which 
takes into account the effect of relief. It 
is the actual distance measured on the 
ground.
To obtain field distance, a map user needs to know:
F the map distance between the two points given 
F the difference in altitude between the two points 
F mathematically it can be expressed as: 
 FD2
 = MD2
 + AD2
The map distance between two points can be obtained from the map. However, 
the difference in altitudes between the same two points can be obtained from the 
contours on the map. The following example will illustrate this briefly.
Example:
a What is the actual distance in the field between point A and point B in 
the map shown below?
Solution
Procedure:
F Measure the distance on the map between the two points using a ruler. 
It is equal to 4 cm.

F The scale of the map = 1:25,000.
b If 1 cm on the map represents 25,000 cm on the ground, how much is 
4 cm on the ground?
Solution:
Scale = Distance on the Map 
Ground distance GD

25,000 = 4 cm
( ) ⇒

GD = 25,000 × 4 cm = 100,000 cm
To convert the distance into kilometers 
 
The difference in altitude between point A and point B can be obtained from 
the contour map. 
The difference in altitude (AD) = (350 – 50) meters
 = 300 meters = 0.3 kilometers
Then, FD can be calculated with the help of the Pythagorean theorem.

Thus, the field distance = 1.04 km.

 UNIT SUMMARY
Þ Direction is always measured clock wise starting from north. Direction can 
be expressed in compass points (N, E, S, W) or in degree (bearings) 
Þ Position of a place can be described from maps by using latitude and 
longitude and national grid reference. The most accurate and international 
method used for locating places on maps is the geographic grid reference 
(latitude and longitude). 
Þ Map enlargement and reduction can be done using a pantograph and 
graphic method. Patograph is an instrument which can be set-up for 
enlarging or reducing maps. Besides maps can be enlarged or reduced by 
using proportional grid squares. Note that whenever any map is enlarged 
or reduced, the scale of that map is also changed proportinally. 
Þ Scale plays a significant role when we enlarge or reduce a map. We can 
perform these procedures accurately by using the grid-square method or 
the instrumental method.
Þ Relief refers to the ups and downs of the earth’s surface. Since ancient 
times, map makers have used different methods to represent relief on 
maps. These days, the most common and accurate way of showing relief 
on modern maps is by contour lines. 
Þ Contourlines are lines drawn on a map joining places of the same elevation 
above sea level. They give almost true altitude. 
Þ Some of the properties of contour lines may include; they are imaginary 
lines and joining points of the same altitude on a map, they are drawn 
at a fixed V.I, they are never cross one another (except in the case of 
overhanging cliff), they are not branch, etc. 
Þ Spot heights, trigonometrical points and benchmarks, are additinal 
methods, which are used to indicate specific heights that are found 
between consecutive contourlines, etc. 
Þ Slope is a deviation of the land surface from the horizontal. The spacing 
between contour lines indicate the types of slopes (like even, concave, 
convex, terraced, etc) on contour maps.

Þ Gradient is the degree or rate of change of slope between two points. It 
can be expressed in the form of ratio, percent and degree. 
Þ Field distance takes into account the ups and downs of the earth’s surface. 
It can be obtained by combining the map distance (horizontal or straight 
line distance) between two points and the altitude difference between 
the same points.
