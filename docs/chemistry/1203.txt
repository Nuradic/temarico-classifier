In Grade 11 Chemistry, you learned about chemical kinetics. What are the main
concerns of chemical kinetics? How do you relate it to thermodynamics?
Thermodynamics is the study of energy and its transformation. In a chemical reaction,
thermodynamics determines whether a reaction is possible and how much product can be
formed.
Thermodynamics deals with energy changes and applies to physical as well as chemical
changes. However, it does not give any information about the duration of time required for
the related processes. Which area of chemistry is concerned with that topic?
Figure 3.1 depicts the concern of chemical kinetics and chemical thermodynamics.

When we study a set of energy changes, we focus our attention on a limited and welldefined part of the universe. In your discussion of Activity 3.1, have you recognized that
we are considering systems? A thermodynamic system may be a solution in a beaker, a gas
in a cylinder, a reaction vessel, an engine, an electrochemical cell, a biological cell, etc.
What do you call the rest of the universe outside a system? Because energy is neither
created nor destroyed, any gain or loss of energy by a system must be accompanied by an
equivalent loss or gain of energy in the surroundings.
There are three types of thermodynamic systems based on the boundary between the
system and its surroundings.
An open system – is a system that can exchange mass and energy, usually in the form
of heat, with its surroundings.
For example, an open system may consist of a quantity of water in an open container,
as shown in Figure 3.2 a.
A closed system – is a system which transfers energy, but not mass across its boundary
with its surroundings. If you close the flask, as in Figure 3.2 b, so that no water vapor
can escape from or condense into the container, you create a closed system.
An isolated system – is a system in which neither the transfer of mass nor that of
energy takes place across its boundary with the surroundings. By placing the water in a
totally insulated container, as shown in Figure 3.2 c, we construct an isolated system.

CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
122
A system is said to be in a certain state if T, P, V, n (observable variables) do not change
with time. An equation that relates these observable variables is called an equation of state.
An ideal-gas equation is an example of equation of state. A thermodynamic function
(expressed in quantity) that depends on the initial and final state of a system, regardless of
how that condition was achieved, is called a state function. Examples are energy, volume,
pressure, etc. Functions that depend on the path are path functions. Examples are heat,
work, etc.
The properties of a system can be intensive or extensive based on its dependence on
amount of a substance.
Intensive properties are those that do not depend on the amount of matter present.
Some examples include colour, temperature and density.
Extensive properties are those properties, that depend on the amount of matter, for
example, mass, internal energy, volume, and pressure.
Activity 3.2
In your group list properties of a system you know. Classify them as intensive or extensive.
Record your conclusions by coping and filling out the following table. Follow the example
that is given in the first line of the tabulation.

A spontaneous process is a process that occurs without external influence. Once
started, requires no action from outside in order to continue. On the other hand, a
non-spontaneous process will not occur unless some external action is continuously
applied.
A rock that is rolling down from the top of a hill continues to roll down. Heat flows from an
object of high temperature to an object of low temperature. Iron rusts in moist air. Each of
these processes occurs spontaneously, without requiring an outside force or agency. If
these processes were to go in the opposite direction, they would be non spontaneous.
Can you mention some other examples of spontaneous and nonspontaneous processes
you encounter in your daily life?
INTRODUCTION TO CHEMICAL THERODYNAMICS (UNIT 3)
123
An isothermal processis a process in which temperature remains constant, DT = 0. This
typically occurs when a system in contact with an outside thermal reservoir (heat bath),
and the change occurs slowly enough to allow the system to continually adjust to the
temperature of the reservoir through heat exchange.
An alternative special case in which a system exchanges no heat with the surroundings (Dq = 0)
is called an adiabatic process. In an isothermal process, the value of DT = 0 but Dq π 0,
while in an adiabatic process, DT π 0 but Dq = 0.

THERMODYNAMIC QUANTITIES

• explain internal energy in relation to the concepts of thermodynamics;
• explain heat in relation to the concepts of thermodynamics;
• explain work in relation to the concepts of thermodynamics;
• state the first law of thermodynamics;

information.
3.2.1 Internal Energy (E)
Activity 3.3
If you have pumped air into a bicycle tyre, you probably noticed a warming effect in the
valve stem. Discuss in a group from where this heat is originated and write a short report
and present to the class.
The internal energy (E) of a system is the total energy contained within a system, partly as
kinetic energy and partly as potential energy. When a chemical system changes from reactants
to products and the product return to the starting reactant, the internal energy has changed.
To determine this change, DE, we measure the difference between the systems internal
energy after the change (Efinal) and before the change (Einitial).
DE = Efinal – Einital
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
124
The kinetic energy component of internal energy consists of various types of molecular
motion and the movement of electrons within molecules.
Potential energy is a factor of:
* attractive and repulsive interaction between molecules;
* attractive interactions between electrons and nuclei within molecules;
* repulsive interactions between electrons within molecules; and
* repulsive interactions between nuclei within molecule.
Activity 3.4
Take ordinary electric bulbs of 100 W, and 150 W; put separate white papers (of equal size
and weight) above the bulbs; after noting the initial temperature of the paper, switch the
bulbs on. Note the temperature of the papers after 15 minutes and 30 minutes
respectively. Do you observe any change in temperature of the papers? Discuss the results
with your classmates.
3.2.2 Heat (Q)
Heat (thermal energy) is the energy transferred between a system and its surroundings as
a result of a difference in their temperatures. Heat passes spontaneously from the region of
higher temperature to the region of lower temperature. Heat transfer stops when the system
and surroundings reach the same temperature and therefore the system and surroundings
are at thermal equilibrium.
Heat and Calorimetry
A chemical reaction or a physical change that releases heat is said to be an exothermic
process. The burning of charcoal, for example, is an exothermic process. A reaction or a
physical change that absorbs heat is an endothermic process. The melting of ice is an
endothermic process, because heat is absorbed when ice melts. The SI unit of heat is joule
(J). Another unit of heat is calorie. A calorie (Cal) is the amount of heat, or other energy,
necessary to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 1 degree Celsius. A kilocalorie
(kCal) is 1000 calories, and 4.184 Joules is equivalent to 1.0 calorie.
Experimentally, we can determine the heat flow associated with chemical reaction by
measuring the temperature change it produces. The measurement of heat flow is called
calorimetry. An apparatus that measures heat is called a calorimeter.
INTRODUCTION TO CHEMICAL THERODYNAMICS (UNIT 3)
125
The temperature change experienced by an object when it absorbs a certain amount of
energy is determined by its heat capacity. Heat capacity is defined as the amount of heat
energy required to raise its temperature by 1° (or 1 K). For pure substances, heat capacity
is usually given for a specified amount of the substance. The heat capacity of 1 mol of a
substance is called its molar heat capacity. In all thermodynamic calculations temperature
must be expressed in Kelvin (K).
The heat capacity of 1g of a substance is called its specific heat. Specific heat of a substance
can be determined experimentally by measuring the temperature change (DT) for a known
mass (m) of a substance that gains or loses a specific quantity of heat, q.

temperature and cool the other beaker 10°C below room temperature. Note the time taken
by both the beakers to attain the room temperature. Discuss the results with your teacher.
3.2.3 Work (W)
How do you determine the pressure-volume work of a gas?
Work, like heat, is an energy transferred between a system and its surroundings. There are
several types of work, but here we will consider only the pressure-volume work that is
done when gases are compressed or expanded.
Suppose we have a gas confined to a cylindrical container that is fitted with a movable
piston as shown in Figure 3.3, where F is the force acting on the piston of area A. Since
pressure is defined as force per unit area, the pressure of the gas is P = 
F
A .
Work is defined as a force applied over a given distance, so if the piston moves a distance
Dh, as shown in Figure 3.3, then the magnitude of the work is
Work = force × distance = F × Dh
Since P = 
F
A , or F = P × A, then
Work = F × Dh = P × A × Dh
INTRODUCTION TO CHEMICAL THERODYNAMICS (UNIT 3)
127
The product of the cross-sectional area of the cylinder, A, and the height, Dh, represents
the change in volume of the gas, which is designated by the symbol DV. By replacing
A × Dh with its equivalent, DV, we see that the work associated with a gas that expands at
constant pressure is described by the following equation.
Work = P × A × Dh = PDV
The product of pressure and a change in volume is usually called “pressure-volume” work.
When a gas expands, DV is positive, and the work is negative.
Work (W) = – PDV
A negative quantity of work signifies that the system loses energy, and that this, energy is
transferred from the system to the surroundings.
When a gas is compressed by its surroundings, DV is negative, the quantity of work is
positive and energy is gained by the system.
Figure 3.3 a The piston, moving a distance Dh against a pressure P, does work on the
surroundings.
b Since the volume of a cylinder is the area of the base times its height, the
change in volume of the gas (DV) is given by A× Dh.

3.2.4 The First Law of Thermodynamics
What are the concepts studied in the first law of thermodynamics?
The first law of thermodynamics, which is a restatement of the law of conservation of
energy, states that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant. When a system
undergoes any chemical or physical change, the accompanying change in its internal energy,
DE, is given by the heat added to the system, q, plus the work done by the system, W.
DE = q + W
Thermodynamic quantities always consist of two parts:
* a number plus units, which gives the magnitude of the change; and
* a sign that indicates the direction of the flow.
The sign reflects the system’s point of view. For example, if a quantity of energy flows into
the system as heat, q is equal to + q, where the positive sign indicates that the system’s
energy is increasing. On the other hand, when energy flows out of the system as heat, q
equal to – q, where the negative sign indicates that the system’s energy is decreasing.
This suggests that we need sign conventions to be used with the first law of thermodynamics.
The conventions are as follows:
* If heat is absorbed by the system, q > 0. If work is done on a system, W > 0.
* If heat is given off by a system, q < 0. If work is done by a system, W < 0.
 Example 3.2
A gas does 135 J of work while expanding and at the same time, it absorbs 156 J
of heat. What is the change in internal energy?
Solution:
Note that heat is absorbed by the system (a positive quantity, + 156 J) and work
is done by the system (a negative quantity, – 135 J). Because more heat is absorbed
than work done, the internal energy increases:
DE = q + W = (+ 156 J) + (–135 J) = + 21 J
Exercise 3.2
1. Calculate DE for a process in which the system absorbs 65 J of heat and 12 J of
work is done on it by the surroundings.
2. A balloon is inflated to its full extent by heating the air inside it. In the final stages of
this process, the volume of the balloon changes from 4.00 × 106 L to 4.50 × 106
L by addition of 1.3 × 108 J of energy as heat. Assuming the balloon expands
against a constant pressure of 1.0 atm, calculate DE for the process.

Form a group and discuss the following questions:
Can water freeze at room temperature; why?
When ice melts at room temperature, the enthalpy decreases or increases? Explain.
Write a short report and present it to the class.
Thermochemistry is the study of energy changes that occur during chemical reactions.
Usually we assess these energy changes in terms of losing and gaining energy in a system.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
130
When we warm our cold hands over a campfire, the burning wood gives off energy as
heat and our hands gain energy, raising their temperature.
3.3.1 Heats of Reactions
In the first law of thermodynamics, you have learned that,
DE = q + pDV
If a reaction occurs at constant volume, then DV = 0 and no pressure-volume work is
done. Thus, DE = (q)
V.
 Where the subscript V indicates a constant-volume process.
Constant volume conditions are often inconvenient, and sometimes impossible, to measure.
What is enthalpy?
Most physical and chemical changes, including those in living systems, take place under
the constant pressure of the earth’s atmosphere. In the laboratory, for example, reactions
are generally carried out in containers that are open to the atmosphere, such as beakers
and test tubes. For most processes, especially those that do not involve gases, only small
amount of work is performed as the system expands or contracts slightly against the pressure
of the atmosphere. Thus, most of the energy gained or lost by the system during these
processes is in the form of heat. The heat absorbed or released by a system at constant
pressure is called enthalpy (H).
Enthalpy is defined as the sum of the internal energy and the pressure-volume product of a
system.
H = E + PV
or DH = DE + PDV (at constant pressure)
DE = q – PDV
then DH = q – PDV + PDV
DH = (q)
P
Thus, the change in enthalpy equals the heat gained or lost at constant pressure.
What is the relationship between DH and DE?
In case of an ideal gas, we can express change in enthalpy, using the ideal-gas law:
PV = nRT
DH = DE + D(PV)
DH = DE + D(nRT)
If the temperature is constant
INTRODUCTION TO CHEMICAL THERODYNAMICS (UNIT 3)
131
DH = DE + DnRT
or DE = DH – DnRT
where ∆ =nn n ∑ ∑P R – of the gaseous substances.
 Example 3.3
Calculate the change in enthalpy when 2 moles of CO is converted to 2 moles of
CO2
 at 1 atm and 25°C.
2CO (g) + O2
 (g) Æ 2CO2 (g) DE = – 563.5 kJ
Solution:
Given T = 25°C = 298 K
 DE = – 563.5 kJ
 Dn = number of moles of gaseous products – number of moles of gaseous reactants
 = 2 – 3 = – 1
 R = 0.082 
L.atm
mol.K = 8.314 J/mol.K
 DH = DE + DnRT
= – 563.5 kJ + (8.314J/mol.K × 298 K × –1 mol)
= – 563.5 kJ – (8.314 × 298) J
= – 563.5 kJ – 2477.6 J
= – 563.5 kJ – 2.5 kJ
= – 566.0 kJ
Is there a significant difference between the values of DH and DE?
Note that if a physical process or reaction occurs under constant-volume conditions, then
the heat change, (q)V, is equal to DE. On the other hand, when a physical process or
reaction is carried out at constant pressure, the heat change, (q)
P, is equal to DH.
Consider the combustion of methane:
CH4
(g) + 2O2
(g) Æ CO2
(g) + 2H2
O(l); C –890.3kJ ° ∆ = H
We say that the enthalpy change in the combustion of 1 mol CH4
(g) at 25°C is 890.3 kJ.
The negative value of DH shows that the combustion of methane at constant pressure is an
exothermic reaction.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
132
Some Properties of Enthalpy
1. Enthalpy is an extensive property. The enthalpy of a system depends on the quantities
of substances present. Consider the formation of ammonia from nitrogen and
hydrogen;
1/2N2
(g) + 3/2H2
(g) U NH3
(g); ∆Hf
 = –45.9 kJ/mol
It is found experimentally that –45.9 kJ of heat is produced when 1/2 mole of
nitrogen reacts with 3/2 moles of hydrogen to produce 1 mole of ammonia at constant
pressure system.
1 mole of nitrogen reacts with 3 moles of hydrogen to form 2 moles of NH3
 and
– 91.8 kJ of heat is produced.
2. The enthalpy change for a reaction is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to DH
for the reverse reaction. For example, if we assume for the reverse reaction of the
formation of ammonia (forward reaction for decompostion of ammonia):
NH3
(g) U 1/2N2
(g) + 3/2H2
(g); ∆Hr
 = +45.9 kJ/mol
H = +45.9 kJ r H = –45.9 kJ f

NH3(g)
Figure 3.4 Reversing a reaction changes the sign but not the magnitude of the
enthalpy change: DHr
 = – DHf
.
3. The enthalpy change for a reaction depends on the state of the reactants and the
products. If the product in the combustion of methane were gaseous H2
O instead of
liquid H2
O, DH would be – 802 kJ instead of – 890.3 kJ. This is due to the absorption
of 88 kJ of heat when 2 mol of liquid water is changed to gaseous water.

O(l) Æ 2H2
O(g); ∆ =+ H 88kJ
Therefore, the states of the reactants and products must be specified.

3.3.2 Standard States
Is there any difference between standard states of ideal gases and standard states
of thermodynamic properties?
The standard state for a substance is the most stable form at temperature of 25°C and at
atmospheric pressure of 1 atm. We can define the standard enthalpy of combustion, DH°
C,
as the change in enthalpy that accompanies the combustion of 1 mole of a substance in
oxygen at standard conditions. Most chemical reactions that produce heat are combustion
reactions. The food we eat is combusted in our bodies in order to give us energy. Most of
the energy our bodies need comes from carbohydrates and fats. Carbohydrates are
decomposed in the intestines into glucose, C6
H12 O6
.
Glucose is soluble in blood and is known as blood sugar. It is transported by the blood to
cells, where it reacts with O2
 in a series of steps, eventually producing CO2
(g), H2
O(l),
and energy.

The breakdown of carbohydrates is rapid, so their energy is quickly supplied to the body.
Standard Enthalpies of Formation
The standard enthalpy of formation, f
° ∆H , is the change in enthalpy in the reaction when
one mole of a substance is formed from the elements in their standard states. By definition,
the standard enthalpy of formation of the most stable form of any element is zero.

Sulfur trioxide SO3(g) – 395.7
Water H2O(l) – 285.8
Water vapor H2O(g) – 241.8
Now let us explore how we can use standard enthalpies of formation to determine standard
enthalpy changes of chemical reactions.
We sum the enthalpies of formation of all reaction products, taking care to multiply each
molar enthalpy of formation by the coefficient of that substance in a balanced equation.
From this, we subtract a similar sum of the enthalpies of formation for the reactants:
( ) ( ) rxn f products f reactants n –m ° ° ° ∆=∆ ∆ HH H ∑ ∑
where, n and m are the stoichiometric coefficients of the chemical reaction.
Example 3.4
The standard enthalpies of formation of NH3, H2
O and NO are –46.2, –241.8
and 90.3 kJ/mol, respectively. Calculate the enthalpy of the reaction:
4NH3

 (g) Æ 6H2
O(l) + 4NO (g)

Now we can multiply these f
° ∆H values by the numbers of moles given by the
coefficients in the equation. In substituting these values into the general equation for
f
° ∆H , remember that we must subtract the sum of the terms for the reactants from
the sum of the terms for products.

 = qsoln + qrxn = 0, so qrxn = –qsoln,
where qsoln is the heat absorbed by the combined solution. Because the density of
the solution is 1.00 g/mL, the mass of a 100 mL solution is 100 g. Thus

 = 2.81 × 103 J = 2.81 kJ
Because qrxn = –qsoln, qrxn = –2.81kJ
The number of moles of both HCl and NaOH in 1.00 × 102 mL solution is:

3.3.3 Hess’s Law
Hess’s law states that if different processes are used to bring about the same change the
enthalpy changes during these processes are the same.
Consider the following cycle, in which Path x from step A Æ B, represents one process,
and path y represents second process through three steps: A Æ C, C Æ D, and D Æ B.
Both paths result in the same change.
DH1
 = HB – HA
If we know how to calculate the enthalpy from A to C, from C to D, and from D to B, then
we can calculate the enthalpy from A to B for path x. This is possible because enthalpy is
a state function. By definition,
DH2
 = HC – HA
DH3
 = HD – HC
DH4
 = HB – HD
According to Hess’s Law, if we add up DH2
, DH3
 and DH4
, we get:
∆ +∆ +∆ = + + = =∆ H2 3 4 CA D C B D BA 1 H H HH H H HH HH H ( ) – – –– ( ) ( )
DH1

 + DH3
 + DH4
This shows that the change in the heat of a reaction is constant, whether the reaction is
carried out directly in one step or through a number of steps.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
138
To apply Hess’s law, you can generally expect to do the following.
Reverse certain equations and change the signs of their DH values. Multiply certain quantities
and their DH values by appropriate factors. The factors may be whole numbers or fractions.
Example 3.7
The enthalpies of combustions, of C to CO2
 and CO to CO2 are –393.5 kJ/mol
and –283.0 kJ/mol, respectively.
1. C(s) + O2
(g) Æ CO2
(g); DH = –393.5 kJ
2. CO(g) + 1/2 O2
(g) Æ CO2
(g); DH = –283.0 kJ
Using these data, calculate the enthalpy of combustion of C to CO.
C(s) + 1/2 O2
(g) Æ CO(g)
Solution:
To apply Hess’s Law, we need to arrange the above equations, (Equation (1) and
equation (2)) so that C(s) on the reactant side and CO(g) on the product side of
the arrow are the same, as we can see in the target equation.
To do this, we need to reverse equation (2) so that CO(g) is a product. Remember
that when reactions are reversed, the sign of DH is also reversed. We arrange the
two equations so that they can be added to give the target equation:
C (s) + O2
 (g) Æ CO2 (g); DH = –393.5 kJ
CO2 (g) Æ CO (g) + 1/2 O2
 (g); DH = 283.0 kJ
 C (s) + 1/2O2

2. C (diamond) + O2
 (g) Æ CO2
 (g); DH = –395.4 kJ
INTRODUCTION TO CHEMICAL THERODYNAMICS (UNIT 3)
139
Solution:
To get the target equation C (graphite) Æ C (diamond) from equation (1) and (2),
we reverse equation (2) and add to equation (1).
C (graphite) + O2 (g) Æ CO2 (g); DH = –393.5 kJ
CO2 (g) Æ C (diamond) + O2 (g); DH = 395.4 kJ
 C (graphite) Æ C (diamond); DH = 1.9 kJ

3.3.4 Bond Energies
Why is bond energy defined only for gases?
Bond energy is the enthalpy required to break a particular bond in 1 mole of gaseous
molecules. This energy is generally expressed in kilojoules per mole of bonds (kJ/mol).
It is easy to understand bond-dissociation energy (D) for diatomic molecules because
there is only one bond (single, double or triple) per molecule. We can represent bonddissociation energy as an enthalpy change or a heat of reaction. The enthalpy change for
the reverse reaction, which is bond formation, is the negative of the bond-dissociation
energy. For example
Bond breaking: Cl2
 (g) Æ 2Cl (g); DH = +243 kJ/mol
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
140
Bond forming: 2Cl (g) Æ Cl2
 (g); DH = –243 kJ/mol
Notice that the bond energy is always a positive quantity; energy is always required to
break chemical bonds. Conversely, energy is released when a bond forms between two
gaseous atoms or molecular fragments. Of course, the greater the bond energy, the stronger
the bond.
Calculations Involving Bond Energies
How do we apply bond energies to calculate DH?
For chemists, reactions involve the breaking and remaking of bonds. So, we can imagine
a process in which we break all the reactant molecules into their respective atoms, and
then recombine the atoms in the way we want. In other words the process we follow is:
Gaseous reactants Æ gaseous atoms Æ gaseous products
The enthalpy of the reaction is estimated as the total energy required to break the bonds
minus the total bond energies of the new bonds formed.
∆ = H ∑ ∑ ( ) bondenergiesof bondsbroken – bondenergiesof ( ) bondsformed

1. Why a ball rolls down a hill but not up?
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12

2. Does this rolling of ball down a hill need any action from outside to occur?
3. List any process that can occur in a system by itself.
4. Decide whether the following become ordered or disordered.
a Solids melt to liquids.
b Solids or liquids vaporize to form gases.
c Solids or liquids dissolve in a solvent to form solutions.
d A chemical reaction produces more number of molecules of gases.
A spontaneous process (change) is a change in a system that proceeds without any outside
influence on the system. For example, when we add solid salt to water, the solid dissolves
without any outside influence. The dissolution is spontaneous. Liquid water freezes to ice
spontaneously below 0°C; ice melts spontaneously at 25°C. When a solution of an acid is
added to a solution of a base, the hydronium ions and hydroxide ions combine spontaneously.
We know well that certain other processes don’t occur by themselves. They are said to be
non-spontaneous. For example, water does not freeze to form ice at room temperature.
The iron oxide of a rusty nail does not revert to iron metal and oxygen gas, solid sodium
chloride does not decompose into sodium metal and chloride gas.
A non-spontaneous process is one that cannot take place without outside influence on the
system.
The fact that a process is spontaneous does not mean that it will occur at an observable
rate. A spontaneous reaction may be very fast, as in the case of acid-base neutralization, or
very slow, as in the case of the rusting of iron. Thermodynamics can tell us the direction
and extent of a reaction, but it can say nothing about its speed. Which field of chemistry
studies the rates of reactions?
What factors make a process spontaneous?
In the previous section, we have seen that the enthalpy change, DH, for a process is an
important factor in determining whether the process is favorable. Those exothermic
processes for which DH is very negative are frequently spontaneous. For example, enough
heat to melt and ignite the metal may be produced by the spontaneous reaction of sodium
with water, and the reaction is exothermic.
2Na (s) + 2H2
O (l) Æ 2NaOH (s) + H2 (g); DH°298 = – 281.9 kJ
However, we shall see that considering only the enthalpy change of a process is not enough.
The spontaneity of a process also depends on how the disorder of the system changes
during the process.
INTRODUCTION TO CHEMICAL THERODYNAMICS (UNIT 3)

Entropy and Entropy Change
Entropy (S) is the thermodynamic property of a system that is related to its degree of
randomness, or disorder. The greater the randomness, or disorder, in a system, the higher
is its entropy. Entropy is one of the most important scientific concepts.
The SI unit of entropy is JK–1 (Joule per Kelvin), which is the same unit as that of heat
capacity. Every substance has entropy as one of its characteristic properties, just as it has
colour, hardness, volume, melting point, density and enthalpy. Is entropy an intensive or
extensive property?
The entropy change, DS, for a chemical change is equal to the sum of the entropies of the
products minus the sum of the entropies of the reactants.
DSrxn = Â mS (product) – Â nS(reactant)
where m and n are the amounts of the individual species represented by their coefficients
in the balanced equation. For a reaction,
aA + bB Æ cC + dD, the entropy change is
∆ ( )( ) ( )( ) CD AB = c×S + d×S – a ×S + b×S       S
where SA is the entropy of A, SB is the entropy of B, and so on.
* DS > 0 indicates an increase in randomness, or disorder, during the change.
* DS < 0 indicates a decrease in randomness, or an increase in order.
In Activity 3.8, in which case does the entropy increase? In which case does the entropy
have a negative sign?
The difference between the entropy change for a process at 298 K and that same process
at some other temperature is generally small and is often ignored. It is common practice to
make the approximation that DS°298 equals DS° for the same process.
DS°rxn = Â mS°(product) – Â nS°(reactant)

Solution:
a The vaporization of a liquid is accompanied by an increase in volume, because
the molecules are distributed throughout a much larger volume in the gaseous
state than in the liquid state, an increase in disorder accompanies vaporization,
thus producing an increase in entropy.
b Sucrose molecules are highly ordered in the solid state, however they are
randomly distributed in aqueous solution. We predict an increase in entropy.
c In this process, the ions that are free to move about the larger volume of the
solution form a solid in which the ions are confined to highly ordered positions.
Thus there is a decrease in entropy.
d Four moles of gaseous reactants produce two moles of gaseous products.
Because two moles of gas in a highly disorganized state of matter are lost, we
predict a decrease in entropy.

3.4.2 The Second Law of Thermodynamics
Write a brief paragraph on the following topic and present it to the class.
If the processes of the universe are not at equilibrium, what would be the effect of the
solar energy on living things?
The connection between entropy and the spontaneity of a reaction is expressed by the
second law of thermodynamics, which states that “The entropy of the universe increases
in a spontaneous process and remains unchanged in an equilibrium process.” Because
the universe is made up of the system and its surroundings, the entropy change in the
universe (DSuniv) for any process is the sum of the entropy changes in the system (DS
sys)
and the surroundings (DSsur).
Mathematically, we can express the second law of thermodynamics as follows:
For a spontaneous process: DSuniv = DS
sys
 + DSsur > 0
For an equilibrium process: DSuniv = DS
sys
 + DSsur = 0
For a spontaneous process, the second law says that DSuniv must be greater than zero, but
it does not place a restriction on either DS
sys
 or DSsur. Thus it is possible for either DS
sys
 or
DSsur to be negative, as long as the sum of these two quantities is greater than zero. For an
equilibrium process, DSuniv is zero. In this case DS
sys
 and DSsur must be equal in magnitude
but opposite in sign.
Free Energy and Free Energy Change
We have seen that the spontaneity of a reaction involves two thermodynamic concepts,
enthalpy and entropy. A new quantity that tells us whether a reaction will be spontaneous
was first developed by the American mathematician J. Willard Gibbs. He proposed a
new state function, now called the Gibbs free energy, or just free energy, designated
by G.
The Gibbs free energy, G, is defined as
G = H – TS
where T is the absolute temperature, S is an entropy and H is an enthalpy.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
148
Activity 3.10
For a process occurring at constant temperature, the change in free energy is given by the
expression
DG = DH – TDS
The Gibbs free energy change gives an unambiguous prediction of the spontaneity of a
chemical reaction run at constant temperature and pressure, because it combines the effect
of both DH and DS. Since temperature, T, has positive value, DS determines the sign of
TDS terms, and the following can be summarized for DG = DH – TDS:
* For a change in which DH < 0 and DS > 0, the change in Gibbs free energy becomes
less than zero (DG < 0), and the process is spontaneous.
* If DH > 0 and DS < 0, the change in Gibbs free energy becomes positive (DG > 0),
and the process is non-spontaneous.
* If DH > 0 and DS > 0, DG may or may not be negative, but only if DH < TDS,
DG < 0.
* If DH < 0 and DS < 0, DG < 0 if TDS is small. This occurs at small value of
temperature.
* If DG is zero, the process is at equilibrium and there is no driving force tending to
make the reaction go in either direction.

Unit Summary
• Thermodynamics is the study of heat, work, and energy and the rules that
govern their inter-conversion. Among its basic ideas are the notion of a
system and its surroundings, the concepts of kinetic energy, potential energy,
and the internal energy and the distinction between two types of energy
exchanges, heat (q) and work (W).
• The first law of thermodynamics (the law of conservation of energy) tells us
that the energy is conserved. That is the energy lost by a system equals that
gained by its surroundings and vice versa.
• Enthalpy change (DH) can be written into chemical equations and
incorporated into conservation factors that relate amounts of substances
with quantities of heat released or absorbed in chemical reactions. In an
exothermic reaction, enthalpy of the system decreases and heat is given off
to the surroundings. In an endothermic reaction, enthalpy increases and heat
is absorbed from the surroundings.
• The standard enthalpy change, DH°, and the standard enthalpy of formation
(heat of formation), DHf
°, are important thermodynamic quantities. The
standard enthalpy of formation of a substance is defined as the enthalpy
change for the formation of 1 mole of that substance from the elements,
with all reactants and products in their standard states.

∆H nH H ° = ∑ ∑ ∆ ° °
f f – m ∆
• A spontaneous change in a system occurs by itself without outside
intervention. The enthalpy change of a system, DH, is a measure of the heat
change in a process. Exothermic processes (DH < 0) tend to occur
spontaneously. The spontaneous character of a reaction is also determined
by the change in randomness or disorder of the system, measured by the
entropy, S. Processes that produce an increase in randomness or disorder of
the system (DS > 0) tend to occur spontaneously.
• The second law of thermodynamics tells us that in any spontaneous process
the entropy of the universe increases. That is
DSsystem + DSsurroundings > 0
• The standard entropy change in a system, DS°, can be calculated from
tabulated standard entropy values, S°, as follows:
DS° = ∑ ∑ (products) m (reactants) o o nS – S

• The Gibbs free energy, G, is a thermodynamic state function that combines
the two state functions enthalpy and entropy:
• G = H – TS. For processes that occur at constant temperature,
DG = DH – TDS
• For a spontaneous process at constant temperature and pressure, DG must
be negative, that is DG < 0. In many cases, the sign of DG can be predicted
just by knowing the signs of DH and DS.
• The standard free energy change, DG°, for any process can be calculated
from tabulated standard free energies of formation,DG°
