chemical reactions are the basis of chemistry. Chemical reactions occur around us all
the time. For example, the burning of fuel, the souring of milk, metabolic processes of
our body and the decay of plants are some familiar chemical reactions in daily life.
A chemical reaction is the process in which reacting substances, called reactants, are
converted to new substances, called products. The characteristics of the products are
completely different from those of the reactants. The conversion process is a chemical
change.
Reactants Æ Products
For example, if you burn magnesium with oxygen, the magnesium and oxygen are
completely converted to magnesium oxide. Magnesium oxide is a soft, white,
crumbling powder. These characteristics of magnesium oxide are completely different
from the characteristics of the original substances, magnesium and oxygen. Magnesium
and oxygen are no longer present in the elemental form.
In summary, a chemical reaction has occurred in which the reactants, magnesium and
oxygen, underwent a complete chemical change, giving the product magnesium oxide.
All chemical reactions include three types of changes in the original substances. These
are changes in composition, properties and energy.
Form a group and perform the following task.
List some chemical processes that occur in your daily life. Identify the reactants and
products in each of these chemical processes.
Present your findings to the class.
Note that, in daily life, we use different terms for the same process of chemical
change. For example “the souring of milk” occurs due to the process of fermentation.
In scientific discussion we generally have a single term for each process.

The law of conservation of mass states that matter is neither created nor destroyed in a
chemical reaction. In other words, the mass of the reactants is exactly equal to the
mass of the products, within the limits of experimental error. This law is also known as
the law of indestructibility of matter.
Mass of reactants = Mass of products
There is no loss or gain of substances during a chemical reaction, and mass is
conserved.
For example, consider the decomposition of mercury (II) oxide. When 100 g of
mercury (II) oxide decomposes by heat, 92.6 g of mercury and 7.4 g of oxygen are
formed. Note that the total mass of mercury and oxygen after decomposition is 100 g:
Form a group and discuss the following phenomenon. When wood burns, the ash weighs
much less than the original wood. Where did the “lost mass” go? How can you estimate
the mass of the wood that is no longer present?
Present your conclusion to the class.
While investigating the quantitative relations between substances in chemical reactions,
scientists formulated the three basic laws of chemical combination. These are:
i) The law of conservation of mass
ii) The law of definite proportions
iii) The law of multiple proportions
i) The Law of Conservation of Mass
In 1774, the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier performed an experiment in which he
heated a sealed glass container that held a sample of tin in air. He measured the mass of
the substances before and after heating and found them to be the same. This and other
similar experimental observations became the basis of the law of conservation of mass.
French chemist Antoine Lavoisier is considered the founder of
modern chemistry. He found that the amount of matter before a
chemical reaction is equal to the amount of matter afterwards, even
though the matter may change in its form. Lavoisier also
experimented with the role of oxygen in combustion and
respiration in both plants and animals.

Objective: To determine the mass of substances before and after a reaction.
Apparatus: Flask, test tube, thread, rubber stopper, balance.
Chemicals: Sodium chloride, silver nitrate.
Procedure:
1. Take 50 mL of silver nitrate solution in a conical flask.
2. Tie a thread around the top of a test tube. Fill the test tube with a saturated
solution of sodium chloride. Suspend the test tube in the flask by means of a
thread held by a rubber stopper, as shown in Figure 4.1.

 CHEMISTRY GRADE 9

ii) The Law of Definite Proportions
The law of definite proportions states that a compound always contains the same
elements in the same proportion by mass. This means that all pure samples of a
compound have the same composition regardless of the source of sample. This law is
also known as the law of constant composition. For example, sample of water could
be obtained from different sources, such as from a river, the ground, or the ocean.
But whatever the original source, all forms of pure water contains 11.2% hydrogen
and 88.8% oxygen by mass. These percentages represent a ratio of 1.0 to 8.0 (1:8),
by mass, of hydrogen to oxygen.
This ratio is constant (fixed) for water. In other words, a compound with a different
ratio of hydrogen and oxygen is not water.
Similarly, in forming the compound ZnO, 65.0 g of zinc combines with 16.0 g of
oxygen. This is 80.2% zinc and 19.8% oxygen, by mass. As is the case for water,
the composition of ZnO is constant. In forming ZnO, zinc combines with oxygen in a
definite proportion.

decomposition)
2. Take 1 g from each of the samples of copper (II) oxide (from i and ii). Place
each of these samples in a watch glass.

iii) The Law of Multiple Proportions
The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements combine to form more
than one compound, the masses of one element combined with a fixed mass of the
second element are in the ratio of small whole numbers. This law can be illustrated by
the two oxides of carbon. The two oxides of carbon are carbon monoxide (CO) and
carbon dioxide (CO2). In CO2, 1.0 g of carbon is combined with 2.67 g of oxygen;
whereas in CO, 1.0 g of carbon is combined with 1.33 g of oxygen. By comparing
2.67 g of oxygen with 1.33 g of oxygen, it is found that the masses of oxygen in the
two compounds that combine with the same mass of carbon are in the simple whole
number ratio, 2:1.
2 2.67 g of oxygen in CO 2 = = 2 :1
1.33 g of oxygen in CO 1
Form a group and perform the following task:

4.3 CHEMICAL EQUATIONS
Competencies
By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
• describe the conventions used to write chemical equations;
• balance chemical equations, using the inspection method;
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
103
• balance chemical equations, using the Least-Common-Multiple (LCM) method.
Form a group and discuss each of the following:
1. What is the difference between a chemical equation and a chemical reaction?
2. Which law is satisfied when a chemical equation is balanced? Take a simple chemical
reaction to illustrate this law.
Present your conclusion to the class.
A chemical equation is a shorthand representation of a chemical reaction in terms of
chemical symbols and formulas. In a chemical equation the starting substances are
called reactants; and the new substances produced are known as products.
Reactants are written on the left side and products on the right side of the equation.
An arrow (→) is placed between the two sides to indicate transformation of reactants
into products.
Reactants Æ products
4.3.1 Writing Chemical Equation
In writing chemical equation, instead of using words, chemical symbols and formulas
are used to represent the reaction.
Steps to Write a Chemical Equation
1. Write a word equation: A word equation is stated in words. For example, the
word equation for the reaction between sodium and chlorine to produce sodium
chloride is written as:
 Sodium + Chlorine Æ Sodium chloride (word equation)
Note that we read the ' + ' sign as 'reacts with' and the arrow can be read as
'to produce', 'to form', 'to give' or 'to yield'.
2. Write the symbols and formulas for the reactants and products in the word
equation.
Na + Cl2 Æ NaCl (Chemical equation)
3. Balance the equation.
2Na + Cl2 Æ 2NaCl
Activity 4.5
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
104
Generally, any chemical equation must fulfil the following conditions:
i) The equation must represent a true and possible chemical reaction.
ii) The symbols and formulas must be written correctly. The elements– hydrogen,
nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine exist as diatomic
molecules. These elements should be written as molecules in the equation.
iii) The equation must be balanced.
A chemical equation has both qualitative and quantitative meanings.
Qualitatively, a chemical equation indicates the types of the reactants and products
in the reaction.
Quantitatively, a chemical equation expresses the relative number (amount)
of moles, molecules or masses of the reactants and products.
4.3.2 Balancing Chemical Equation
Which should be adjusted in balancing a chemical equation, the subscripts or
the coefficients?
According to the law of conservation of mass, atoms are neither created nor
destroyed during a chemical reaction. As a result, the number of atoms of each
element should remain the same before and after the reaction. Therefore, the main
reason why all chemical equations must be balanced is just to obey the law of
conservation of mass.
To balance a chemical equation means to equalize the number of atoms on both sides
of the equation by putting appropriate coefficients in front of the formulas.
Only two methods of balancing chemical equations will be discussed under this topic.
These are the inspection and the Least Common Multiple (LCM) method.
1. The Inspection Method
Most simple chemical equations can be balanced using this method. Balancing an
equation by inspection means to adjust coefficients by trial and error until the equation
is balanced. Follow the following four steps to balance the chemical equation.
Step 1: Write the word equation.
Step 2: Write the correct symbols or formulas for the reactants and products.
Step 3: Place the smallest whole number coefficients in front of the symbols or
formulas until the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides
of the equation.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
105
Step 4: Checking: By counting the number of atoms on both sides of the equation,
make sure that the atoms of all elements are balanced and also the
coefficients are expressed as the smallest whole number ratio.
Note:
When you balance an equation, do not change any symbol or formula of any compound.
If you change a symbol or formula, it no longer represents the element or compound
required by the equation.
Example 1
Balance the equation for the reaction between magnesium and oxygen to
produces magnesium oxide.
Solution:
Step 1: Magnesium + Oxygen Æ Magnesium oxide
Step 2: Mg + O2 Æ MgO (unbalanced)
Step 3: Put coefficients to balance the equation
• Oxygen is not balanced. There are two oxygen atoms on the left side and
one on the right side. Hence, place the coefficient 2 in front of MgO.
Mg + O2 Æ 2MgO (unbalanced)
• Now Mg is not balanced. There is one Mg on the left side and two on the
right side. Thus, place the coefficient 2 in front of Mg.
2Mg + O2 Æ 2MgO (balanced)
Step 4: Checking: There are two Mg and two O atoms on each side of the
equation. Therefore, the equation is correctly balanced.
2Mg + O2 Æ 2MgO
Exercise 4.2
Balance the following chemical equation, using the inspection method:
1. Na + H2O Æ NaOH + H2
2. CaCO3 Æ CaO + CO2
3. H2O2 Æ H2O + O2
4. Al + H3PO4 Æ AlPO4 + H2
5. HNO3 + H2S Æ NO + S + H2O
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
106
2. The LCM Method
In the LCM method, the coefficients for the balanced chemical equation are obtained
by taking the LCM of the total valency of reactants and products and then dividing it
by total valency of reactants and products. All the necessary steps to balance a
chemical equation by the LCM method, are shown by the following examples.
Example 2
When aluminium reacts with oxygen, aluminium oxide is formed. Write
the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.
Solution:
Step 1: Represent the reaction by a word equation.
Aluminium + Oxygen Æ Aluminium oxide
Step 2: Change the words to symbols and formulas for the reactants and
products.
Al + O2 Æ Al2O3
Step 3: Place the total valency of each atom above it.
3 4 66
Al O Al O 2 23 + Æ
Now the equation shows
• The valency of aluminium as 3.
• The total valency of oxygen is 2 × 2 = 4.
• The total valency of aluminium in Al2
O3
 is 3 × 2 = 6.
• The total valency of oxygen in Al2O3 is 2 × 3 = 6.
Step 4: Find the LCM of each total valency and place it above the arrow.
3 4 6 6
2 2 3
12 Al + O → L.C.M Al O
Step 5: Divide the LCM by each total valency number to obtain the coefficients
for each of the reactants and products. Place the obtained coefficients
in front of the respective formulas.
4Al + 3O2 Æ 2Al2O3 (balanced)
Checking: There are 4 aluminium and 6 oxygen atoms on both sides of the
 equation. Hence, the chemical equation is correctly balanced.

4.4 ENERGY CHANGES IN CHEMICAL REACTIONS

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• explain energy changes in chemical reactions;
• define endothermic and exothermic reactions;
• describe endothermic and exothermic reactions;
• illustrate endothermic and exothermic reactions using diagrams;
• conduct simple experiment to demonstrate exothermic and endothermic reactions;

Present your conclusion to the class.
Almost all chemical reactions are accompanied by energy changes. These energy
changes could be in the form of heat energy, light energy, electrical energy, and so on.
Activity 4.6
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
109
On the basis of energy changes, chemical reactions can be divided into exothermic
and endothermic reactions.
4.4.1 Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions
Can heat energy be considered as a reactant or product?
Exothermic Reaction
A chemical reaction that releases heat energy to the surroundings is known as an
exothermic reaction. During an exothermic process, heat is given out from the system
to its surroundings and this heat energy is written on the right side of the equation as
shown below.
Reactants Æ Products + Heat
For example, the burning of carbon with oxygen produces carbon dioxide and heat is
released during the reaction. Thus, the reaction is exothermic and written as:
C + O2 Æ CO2 + Heat
Endothermic Reaction
A chemical reaction which absorbs heat energy from the surroundings is known as an
endothermic reaction. During an endothermic process, heat flows into the system from
its surroundings and the heat is written on the left side of the equation.
Reactants + Heat → products
For example, the reaction between carbon and sulphur to form carbon disulphide is
an endothermic reaction because heat is absorbed in the reaction.
C + 2S + Heat Æ CS2
The amount of heat energy liberated or absorbed by a chemical reaction is called heat
of reaction or change in enthalpy for the reaction. It is symbolized as ∆H. Its unit is
expressed in kilojoules per mol( ) kJ
mol . The change in enthalpy (∆H) is the difference
between the energy of the products and the energy of the reactants.
∆H = H
p – Hr
; where H
p is the heat content (energy) of the product, Hr
 is the
heat content (energy) of the reactant.
4.4.2 Energy Diagrams
For endothermic reactions, DH is positive because the energy of the product is higher
than the energy of the reactant. As a result, the enthalpy of the system increases as
shown in Figure 4.3.
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
110
since, H
p
> Hr
, DH = positive (DH > 0)
For example, when nitrogen reacts with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide, 66.4 kJ of
heat energy is absorbed (i.e., DH = + 66.4 kJ/mol) and thus the reaction is
endothermic.
N2 (g) + 2O2 (g) Æ 2NO2 (g); DH = + 66.4 kJ/mol
Figure 4.3 Energy diagram for an endothermic reaction.
For exothermic reactions, DH is negative because the energy of the reactants is
greater than the energy of the products. Thus, the enthalpy of the system decreases,
as shown in Figure 4.4.
H
p
 < Hr
 fi ∆H = negative (DH < 0)
For example, when carbon burns in oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, 393.5 kJ of
heat energy is liberated and hence the reaction is exothermic (∆H = –393.5 kJ/mol).
C(s) + O2(g) Æ CO2(g): DH = –393.5 kJ/mol

Form a group and perform the following task. In your daily life you encounter with many
chemical changes involving energy. List some of such changes and discuss their
importance.
Share your findings with the rest of the class.
Chemical reactions bring about chemical changes. All chemical changes are
accompanied by energy changes. This energy is usually in the form of heat, light, or
electricity.
Energy changes produced by chemical reactions have many practical applications
(uses). For example, energy lifts rockets, runs cars, and extracts metal from
compounds.
Many applications involve the energy produced by fuel combustion, which liberates
large amounts of heat. The energy can be converted from one form to another. For
example, the energy that fuel combustion produces can convert water to steam.
The steam can run a turbine that creates electricity.
Respiration (breathing) creates energy for our bodies. Breathing releases the energy
our living cells produce by oxidizing glucose. This energy helps to maintain our
body temperature and body exercises.

A decomposition reaction is a reaction that involves the breaking down of a single
compound into two or more elements or simpler compounds. A decomposition
reaction can be carried out using heat, light, electricity or a catalyst. But most
decomposition reactions are carried out when heat is supplied and this heat energy is
indicated by a ‘delta’ (∆) symbol above the arrow. The general form of equation for

A reaction in which one element displaces another element from its compound is
known as single displacement or replacement reaction. Such a reaction is represented
by the following two general forms.
A + BC Æ B + AC
If A is a metal, it will displace B to form AC, provided A is a more active metal
than B.
A + BC Æ BA + C
If A is a non-metal, it will displace C to form BA, provided A is a more active
non-metal than C.

 CHEMISTRY GRADE 9

The quantitative relationship between reactants and products in a balanced chemical
equation is known as stoichiometry. In other words, stoichiometry is the study of the
amount or ratio of moles, mass, energy and volumes (for gases) of reactants and
products. Stoichiometric calculations are based on the following two major principles.
i) The composition of any substance in the chemical equation should be expressed
by a definite formula.
ii) The law of conservation of mass must be obeyed (the mass of reactants equals
the mass of products).
4.6.1 Molar Ratios in Balanced Chemical Equation
From a balanced chemical equation, it is possible to determine the:
• number of moles of each reactant and product; and
• relative mass of each of the reactants and products
For example, in the reaction of hydrogen with oxygen to produce water, 2 moles of
H2 combines with 1 mole of O2 to yield 2 moles of H2O. The equation also tells us
4 g of hydrogen reacts with 32 g of oxygen to produce 36 g of water. This can be
further interpreted as follows:
 2H2(g) + O2(g) Æ 2H2O(l)
 Mole Æ 2 mole 1 mole 2 mole
 Molecule Æ 2 molecule 1 molecule 2 molecule
 Mass Æ 4 g 32 g 2 × 18 g
 36 g reactant 36 g product
Calculations based on chemical equations (stoichiometric problems) are classified
into mass-mass problem, volume-volume problems and mass-volume problems.
4.6.2 Mass–Mass Relationships
In mass-mass problems, the mass of one substance is given, and the mass of the
second substance is determined from the same reaction. There are two methods for
solving such types of problems:
i) Mass-ratio method
ii) Mole-ratio method
Let us see each method by using the necessary steps.

CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY

i) The mass-ratio method
In this type of stoichiometric calculation, the mass of one substance is determined
from the given mass of the other substance using the following steps.
Step 1: Write the balanced chemical equation.
Step 2: Place the given mass above the corresponding formula, and x above the
formula of the substance whose mass is to be determined.
Step 3: Write the total molar mass of the substances below the formula of each
substance. (Total molar mass is the molar mass of the substance
multiplied by its coefficient).
Step 4: Set up the proportion.
Step 5: Solve for the unknown mass, x.
Example 1
How many grams of calcium chloride are formed when 15 g of calcium metal
reacts with hydrochloric acid?

ii) The mole-ratio method
The mole ratio is the ratio between the numbers of moles of any two substances in a
given reaction. In this method, the given mass is converted into moles, and the number
of moles for the required substance is calculated. If needed, convert the obtained
moles back to mass.
Follow the steps given below to solve problems of mass-mass relationships by the
mole ratio method:
Step 1: Write the balanced chemical equation.
Step 2: Convert the given mass to moles and write the obtained moles and the
required quantity, x, above the formulas of the respective substances.
Step 3: Place the coefficients as the number of moles under the formula of each
substance involved.
Step 4: Set up the proportion.
Step 5: Solve for the unknown value, x; and convert the moles obtained into mass.
Example 3
How many grams of sodium metal are needed to react with 10.0 g of water?
Solution:
Step 1: 2Na + 2H2O Æ 2NaOH + H2

Therefore, 12.88 g of sodium metal is needed to react with 10 g of water.

reaction that produces 0.05 moles of O2
?
6. How many moles of CaO are needed to react with excess water to produce
370 g of calcium hydroxide?
4.6.3 Volume-Volume Relationships
In reactions involving gases, the volume of gases can be determined on the principle
that 1 mole of any gas occupies a volume of 22.4 litres at STP (standard
temperature and pressure, STP, the temperature is 0°C and the pressure is 1 atm).
It is also known that 22.4 L of any gas weighs exactly its molecular mass at STP. This
volume, 22.4 litres, of a gas is known as the molar volume.
At STP, 1 mole of any gas = 22.4 L = gram volume mass of the gas
The relationship between the volume of a gas and its number of molecules was
explained by Avogadro. Avogadro's law states that equal volumes of different gases,
under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain equal number of
molecules. This law can also be stated as the volume of a gas is proportional to the
number of molecules (moles) of the gas at STP.

4.6.4 Mass–Volume Relationships
In mass-volume problems, either the mass of one substance is given and the volume
of the other is required or the volume of one substance is given and the mass of the
other one is required. The steps to solve such type of problems are the same as the
previous steps except putting the masses on one side and the volumes on the other
side of the equality sign.

4.6.5 Limiting and Excess Reactants
When all the reactants are completely consumed in a chemical reaction, then such
reactants are said to be in stoichiometric proportions. But, practically these types of
chemical reactions do not always occur. In many cases, an excess of one or more
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
132
reactants is encountered in the reaction and the other reactant is completely converted
into products. Thus, the reactant that is completely consumed in the reaction is known
as the limiting reactant, because it limits or determines the amount of products that can
be formed.
For example, consider the following reaction:
 H2 + Cl2 Æ 2HCl
1 mole 1 mole 2 moles
According to the equation, 1 mole of H2 reacts with 1 mole of chlorine to produce 2
mole of HCl. Thus, all the reactants are completely consumed and only products
appear. However if 1 mole of H2 reacts with 1.5 mole of Cl2, there is insufficient H2
to react with all of the Cl2. Therefore, Cl2
 will be in excess and H2 will be the limiting
reactant. Only 2 moles of HCl are formed and at the end of the reaction 0.5 mole of
Cl2 remains unreacted.
Example 8
How much ammonia is produced if 10 g of hydrogen reacts with 18 g of
nitrogen?
Solution:
3H2(g) + N2(g) Æ 2NH3(g)
First determine the number of moles;
Moles of H2 = 
10 g = 5 mol
2 g/mol
Moles of N2 = 
18 g
28 g/mol = 0.64 mol
Now, calculate the number of moles or masses of the product that would be
formed by each reactant.
The reactant that gives the smallest amount of product is the limiting reactant.

CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
133
Therefore, the limiting reactant is nitrogen, because it gives less amount of
NH3, i.e., 21.8 g NH3. In the reaction, 0.64 mole (18 g) of N2 is consumed.
Hydrogen is in excess. The amount of hydrogen consumed will be:

Example 9
In the chemistry laboratory, a student performed a displacement reaction by
adding 9.5 g of zinc into 9.5 g of HCl in a beaker. What weight of ZnCl2 will

Moles of Zn = 9.5 g
65 g/mol = 0.15 mol
Moles of HCl = 9.5 g
36.5 g/mol
 = 0.26 mol
Even though the given masses of the two reactants are the same, they are not
mixed in equimolar ratio as shown above. Thus, the limiting reactant must be
determined first.

4.6.6 Theoretical, Actual and Percentage Yields
The measured amount of product obtained in any chemical reaction is known as the
actual yield. The theoretical yield is the calculated amount of product that would be
obtained if the reaction proceeds completely. The actual yield (experimentally
determined yield) of a product is usually less than the theoretical yield (calculated
yield).
The percentage yield is the ratio of the actual yield to the theoretical yield multiplied by
100.

 4.7 OXIDATION AND REDUCTION REACTIONS
Competencies
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
• define redox reactions;
• define the terms oxidation and reduction in terms of electron transfer;
• define oxidation number (oxidation state),
• state oxidation number rules,
• determine the oxidation number of an element in a given formula;
• describe the oxidizing and reducing agents;
• analyze a given redox reaction by specifying the substance reduced and the
substance oxidized, and also the oxidizing and reducing agents; and
• Distinguish between redox and non-redox reactions.
Form a group and discuss the following phenomenon:
When you dry your meal dishes with a towel, the towel can be termed as a drying agent
and the dish as wetting agent. What happens to the towel and the dish, in terms of
getting wet and dry, after cleaning? Relate this idea with oxidizing agent and reducing
agent, oxidation and reduction of substances. Present your conclusion to the class.
In our day to day activity, we are familiar with the chemical processes like rusting of
iron, burning of substances, breathing of air, digestion of food and so on. All such
types of processes or reactions are known as oxidation and reduction or redox
reactions.
4.7.1 Oxidation-Reduction
Can oxidation take place without reduction?
Oxidation: is the process in which a substance loses electrons in a chemical reaction.
For example, in the reaction
2Na + Cl2 Æ 2NaCl
Activity 4.10
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
137
Each sodium atom has lost one electron and has turned to a sodium ion.
Hence, sodium is oxidized.
Na + 1e– Æ Na+
Reduction: is the process in which a substance gains electrons in a chemical
reaction.
For example, in the above reaction each chlorine atom has gained an
electron and has changed to chloride ion. Thus, chlorine is reduced;
Cl2 + 2e– Æ Cl–
The processes of oxidation and reduction always occur simultaneously because if one
substance loses electrons, the other substance must gain these electrons. Since the
process of oxidation and reduction involves the transfer of electrons, it also results in
the changes of oxidation number. Thus, oxidation and reduction can also be defined in
terms of oxidation number. Oxidation is an increase in the oxidation number of an
element and reduction is a decrease in the oxidation number. For example, in the
reaction,
The oxidation number of sodium is increased from 0 to +1 and thus sodium is
oxidized. The oxidation number of chlorine is decreased from 0 to –1, and therefore
chlorine is reduced.
4.7.2 Oxidation Number or Oxidation State
Oxidation number or oxidation state is the number of electrons that an atom appears
to have gained or lost when it is combined with other atoms.
Rules for Assigning Oxidation Numbers
Rule 1: The oxidation number of all elements in free state is zero. This rule is also
applied for diatomic or polyatomic elements.
Example: The oxidation number of Na = 0, Cu = 0, Cl in Cl2 = 0, O in
O3 = 0, S in S8
 = 0.
Rule 2: The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to the charge on the ion.
Example: Na+ = +1, Mg2+ = +2, S2 – = –2.
Rule 3: The oxidation number of oxygen in a compound is usually – 2 except in the
following cases:
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
138
Exceptions
The oxidation number of oxygen in:
i) peroxides is –1. Example: Na2O2
ii) superoxides is –1/2. Example: KO2
iii) oxygen diflouride is +2. Example: OF2
Rule 4: The oxidation number of hydrogen in its entire compounds is +1 except
in metal hydrides, (like NaH, CaH2 and AlH3), where its oxidation
number is –1.
Rule 5: The sum of the oxidation number of all the atoms in a neutral compound is
zero.
Example: +1 +6 -2
H SO2 4 ((+2) + (+6) + (–8) = 0)
Rule 6: In a polyatomic ion, the sum of the oxidation numbers of the constituent
atoms equals the charge on the ion.
Example: +6 –2 –2 (SO )4 ((+6) + (–8) = –2)
Rule 7: Elements of group IA have +1 and group IIA have +2 oxidation states in all
of their compounds.
Rule 8: In a compound, the more electronegative element is assigned a negative
oxidation number, and the less electronegative element is assigned a positive
oxidation number.
Example :
+3 –1
N Cl3 (chlorine is more electronegative than nitrogen)
Example 1

The oxidation number of O is –2 (Rule 3)

(1 × 2) + (x × 2) + (–2 × 7) = 0
2 + 2x – 14 = 0

x = +7
Therefore, the oxidation number of Mn in MnO4
– is +7.

4.7.3 Oxidizing and Reducing Agents
In a redox reaction, the substance that causes another substance to get oxidized, but
itself gets reduced, is known as an oxidizing agent, or oxidant. In the same manner,
the substance that causes another substance to get reduced, but itself oxidized, is
referred to as a reducing agent or reductant.
• Oxidizing agents are substances that:
– are reduced (gain electrons)
– contain elements whose oxidation number decreases
• Reducing agents are substances that:
– are oxidized (lose electrons)
– contain elements whose oxidation number increases
Tests for an oxidizing agent are accomplished by mixing it with a substance which is
easily oxidized to give a visible colour change when the reaction takes place.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
141
For example,
i) Permanganate ion (MnO4
– ) in acidic solution changes colour from purple to
colourless.
MnO4
– → Mn2+
ii) Dichromate in acidic solution changes colour from orange to green.
Cr2O7
 2– → Cr3+
Other common oxidizing agents are chlorine, potassium chromate, sodium chlorate
and manganese (IV) oxide.
Similarly, certain reducing agents undergo a visible colour change with a substance
which is easily reduced.
For example,
i) A moist starch solution changes potassium iodide paper to blue-black to show
that iodine is formed, 2I– → I2. That is potassium iodide is a reducing agent.
ii) Hydrogen sulphide bubbled through a solution of an oxidizing agent forms a
yellow precipitate, S2– → S. That is H2S is a reducing agent.
Other common reducing agents are carbon, carbon monoxide, sodium
thiosulphate, sodium sulphite and iron (II) salts.
The oxidizing or reducing ability of substances depend on many factors. Some
of these are:
• Electronegativity: Elements with high electronegativity such as F2, O2, N2 and
Cl2
 are good oxidizing agents. Elements with low electronegativity for example,
metallic elements like Na, K, Mg and Al are good reducing agents.
• Oxidation states: In a compound or ion, if one of its elements is in a higher
oxidation state, then it is an oxidizing agent. Similarly, if an element of a compound
or ion is in a lower oxidation state, then it is a reducing agent..

Oxidation and reduction reactions are called Redox reactions. Oxidation and
reduction reaction take place simultaneously in a given reaction.
Activity 4.11
Form a group and discuss the following:
1. Why a reducing agent undergoes oxidation?
2. Why must every redox reaction involve both an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent?
Present your discussion to the class.
Example 4
Identify the oxidizing agent, reducing agent, the substance oxidized and reduced
in the following reaction.
H2S + Br2 Æ 2HBr + S
Solution:
Let us assign oxidation number to all the elements of the reactants and products.
In the reaction, the S atom in H2S increases its oxidation number from –2 to
0. Hence, S is oxidized and H2
S is a reducing agent. The oxidation number of
Br is decreased from 0 to –1. Thus, Br2 is reduced and is an oxidizing agent.
Example 5
Write the oxidizing and reducing agents for the reaction given below:
Cu + HNO3 Æ Cu(NO3)2 + NO + H2O
Solution:
Write the oxidation numbers of each element and identify the substances which
undergo a change in oxidization number.

Non-redox Reactions
So far we have discussed oxidation and reduction reaction or redox reactions.
However, there are also reactions in which oxidation and reduction do not occur and
such types of reactions are known as non-redox reactions.
In non-redox reactions, no electrons are exchanged between the reacting substances.
Therefore, the oxidation numbers of the atoms do not change in the reaction. Usually such
types of reactions involve the exchange of positive and negative ions. Most of the double
displacement reactions and acid-base reactions are not oxidation-reduction reactions.

smooth curve through maximum points.
4. Why the graph is steep in the beginning but horizontal at the end of the reaction?
5. At what time does the reaction stop?
Every chemical reaction proceeds at different rates or speed. Some reactions proceed
very slowly and may take a number of days to complete; while others are very rapid,
requiring only a few seconds.
The rate of a chemical reaction measures the decrease in concentration of a reactant
or the increase in concentration of a product per unit time. This means that the rate of
a reaction determines how fast the concentration of a reactant or product changes
with time. The rate of a reaction is obtained by determining the concentration of
reactants or products during the reaction. Methods for determining the concentration
of reactants or products depend on the type of reactions. Some of the methods are:
a Colour (changes in colour)
b Pressure (increase or decrease in pressure, particularly in gases)
c Volume (increase or decrease in size, particularly in gases)
d Mass (gain or loss in weight)
e Amount of precipitate formed
Generally, the rate of a reaction can be obtained by measuring either one of the above
changes in properties of substances and consequently relating to changes in their
concentrations during the course of the reaction.
Change in concentration of substance Rateof reaction =
Change in time
∆ = ∆

From this expression, it follows that the rate of a reaction is inversely proportional to
the time taken by the reaction.

Figure 4.12 illustrates the changes of the rate of a chemical reaction with time. A
reaction becomes slower as reactants are consumed. The reaction rate curve becomes
less steep until it becomes a horizontal straight line. No more reactant is used up at
this point.

Note that the rate of a reaction is the slope of the tangent to the curve at any
particular time.

Reading Check

acid, hydrogen gas is evolved. When a graph of volume versus time is drawn, show
that the total volume of the gas evolved can be measured at fixed intervals.
Pre-conditions for a Chemical Reaction
Chemical reactions are usually explained by the collision theory. The assumption of the
collision theory is that chemical reactions take place due to the collision between
molecules.
1. Collisions between reactants
The first precondition for a reaction to occur is the direct contact of the reacting
substance with each other. However, all collisions between molecules are not
necessarily effective in bringing a reaction.
2. Activation energy
If the collisions between the reactant molecules do not have sufficient energy, then no
reaction will occur. Therefore, for the reaction to take place collision must always
occur with sufficient energy to break the bonds in the reactants and form new bonds
in the product. Thus, minimum amount of energy needed for the reaction is known as
activation energy.
3. Proper Orientation
Collision of molecules with sufficient activation energy will not bring a reaction if the
reacting molecules are poorly oriented. Thus, the collision between molecules should
have the proper orientation.
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 9
148
Activity 4.13
Consider the reaction between H2
 and Cl2
 molecules:
H2 + Cl2 Æ 2HCl
For the reaction to occur, first H2 and Cl2 molecules must collide with each other. For
the collision to be effective, these colliding molecules (H2
 and Cl2
) must have sufficient
energy to break the H – H and Cl – Cl bonds and consequently to form new H – Cl
bonds.
Unless, the H2
 and Cl2
 molecules are oriented in proper positions, there is no product
formed. Therefore, as shown in Figure 4.13(c) the H2 and Cl2 molecules rearrange
themselves so as to form a new H – Cl molecule.

Factors Affecting the Rates of Chemical Reaction
Form a group and discuss each of the following:
1. How is the burning of charcoal affected by:
a increasing the amount of air used
b adding more charcoal.
2. How can you increase the rate of combustion of a given block of wood ?
Present your findings to the class.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS AND STOICHIOMETRY
149
The rate of a chemical reaction depends on nature of reactants, temperature, and
concentration of reactants, surface area and catalysts.
The collision theory assumes that the rate of a reaction depends on the number
(frequency) of collisions of particles and those factors which affect the frequency of
collisions will also affect the rate of a reaction. Now let us discuss each factor.
1. Nature of the reactants
The rate of a reaction is influenced by the type and nature of the reacting substances.
For example, the following reactions have different rates due to the nature of the
reactants, Mg, Fe and Cu.
Mg + 2HCl Æ MgCl2 + H2 ... (very fast reaction)
Fe + 2HCl Æ FeCl2 + H2 ... (slow reaction)
Cu + HCl Æ No reaction
2. Temperature
An increase in temperature increases the rate of a reaction. This is because as the
temperature increases, the average kinetic energy of the particles increases which in
turn increases the number of effective collisions.
In general, for many chemical reactions, the rate of a reaction doubles for every 10°C
rise in temperature.
3. Concentration of reactants
The number of collisions is proportional to the concentration of reactants. The higher
the concentration of the reactants, the more collisions between the reacting particles
and thus the higher the rate of the reaction.
For example, if you heat a piece of steel wool in air (21% oxygen by volume) it burns
slowly. But in pure oxygen (100% oxygen by volume) it bursts in to a dazzling white
flame. This indicates that the rate of burning increases as the concentration of oxygen
is higher.

4. Surface area
When the reactants are in different phases, be it solid, liquid or gas, then the surface
area of the substances affect the rate of the reaction. The higher the surface area of
reactants, the faster is the rate of the reaction. This is because more contact results in
more collisions between each small particle of reactants.

A catalyst speeds up the rate of a reaction by providing an alternative reaction path
with lower activation energy. Lower activation energy for a reaction corresponds to
the higher reaction rate. Figure 4.16 illustrates how the presence of catalysts speeds
up a reaction.

4.8.2 Chemical Equilibrium
In the previous chapters, we came across chemical reactions in which all the reactants
are completely converted to products. Such types of reactions are known as
irreversible reactions. Irreversible reactions proceed only in one direction (forward
direction) and expressed by a single arrow (→).
Examples
2Na + Cl2 Æ 2NaCl
2KClO3 Æ 2KCl + 3O2
However, there are many chemical reactions that do not proceed to completion. The
products at the same time react to give (produce) the reactants. These are called
reversible reactions.
Reversible reactions take place in both the forward and backward directions under
the same conditions. A double arrow (←→
 ) or ( YZZ ZZX ) pointing in opposite
directions is used in such reaction equations.
Example
N2 + 3H2 YZZ ZZX 2NH3
The forward reaction proceeds from left to right and the reaction that goes from right
to left is the reverse reaction.
Does a reaction stop if it attains equilibrium?
Chemical equilibrium is the state of a chemical system in which the rates of the
forward and reverse reactions are equal. At the state of chemical equilibrium, there is
no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products because the system is in
dynamic equilibrium. Dynamic equilibrium means the reaction does not stop and both
the forward and the backward reactions continue at equal rates.
At equilibrium, Rate of forward reaction = Rate of reverse reaction
The law of chemical equilibrium can be expressed mathematically using the molar
concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium. The concentration of species
is denoted by enclosing the formula in square bracket [ ].
Thus, for the reversible reaction:
aA+bB YZZ ZZX cC + dD
Rate of forward reaction = Kf
 [A]a [B]b where Kf
 and Kr
 are rate constants for the
Rate of reverse reaction = Kr
 [C]c
 [D]d forward and reverse reactions respectively.

However, at equilibrium the forward and the reverse reaction rates are equal.

Factors that Affect Chemical Equilibrium
Activity 4.18
Form a group and try to explore at least two properties that can be utilize to determine
the state of chemical equilibrium in system.
Present your findings to the class.
A system remains at a state of chemical equilibrium if there is no change in the
external conditions that disturb the equilibrium. But the point of equilibrium could be
affected due to any external factors like temperature, pressure, concentration and so
on. How a system at equilibrium adjusts itself to any of these changes is stated by the
French chemist Henri Le Chatelier in 1888.
Le Chatelier states that if a stress is applied to a system in equilibrium, the system
will respond in such a way to counteract the stress. The stress could be change in
temperature, concentration or pressure.
The factors affecting chemical equilibrium and their effects:
1. Effect of temperature
The effect of temperature changes on equilibrium depends on whether the reaction is
exothermic or endothermic. An increase in the temperature of a system will favour an
endothermic reaction and a decrease in temperature favors an exothermic reaction.
For example, consider the following reaction:
H2O(g) + CO(g) YZZ ZZX H2(g) + CO2(g); ∆H = – 41 kJ
Since the reaction is exothermic,
i) if temperature is increased, the system will shift to the left.
ii) if temperature is decreased, the system will shift to the right and a high yield of
products (H2 and CO2) is obtained.

2. Effect of Pressure or Volume
Pressure changes only affect equilibrium reaction involving gaseous reactants and
products. The effect of pressure on liquids and solids is negligible. An increase in
pressure (or decrease in volume) on a gaseous system shifts the equilibrium in the
direction of forming smaller number of moles of gas. On the contrary, decreasing the
pressure shifts the equilibrium in the direction of forming more number of moles of the
gas. For example, in the reaction,
2 2
3 moles of gases 2 moles of gases
2CO(g) + O (g) 2CO (g) YZZ ZZX 	
 	

There are 3 moles of reactants and 2 moles of product.
Therefore, increasing the pressure of the system shifts the equilibrium to the forward
direction. This results in a higher yield of CO2
. Decreasing the pressure of the gaseous
mixture shifts the equilibrium in the reverse direction.
When the number of moles of reactants and products are equal, pressure has no
effect on the equilibrium. For example, in the following reaction;
2 2
2 moles of gases 2 molesof gases
H (g) + I (g) YZZ ZZX 2HI (g)
	
 	

the number of moles of reactants and products are equal (2 mol each) and hence no
effect of pressure on the equilibrium.

4. 2SO2(g) + O2(g) YZZ ZZX 2SO3(g) + heat
5. N2O4(g) + heat YZZ ZZX 2NO2(g)
6. PCl3(g) + Cl2(g) YZZ ZZX PCl5(g) + 21 kJ

3. Effect of Concentration
According to Le Chatelier’s principle, any change in the concentration of a reactant or
product will lead to a change in the concentration of the substances on the other side
of the equation.
If one of the reactants is added to the equilibrium mixture, the system shifts to the
forward direction and a high yield of product is obtained. To the contrary, if more
product is added to the system, the equilibrium shifts to the reverse direction. For
example, in the reaction,
N2 + 3H2 YZZ ZZX 2NH3
If the concentration of N2 or H2 is increased (i.e., if more N2 or H2 is added), the
equilibrium will shift to the right direction and more NH3 will be produced.
4. Effect of catalysts
Catalysts change the speed of both the forward and reverse reactions equally.
However, catalysts do not affect the state of chemical equilibrium of a reaction. This
means that the position of equilibrium will not be shifted due to the presence of a
catalyst.
How can Le-Chatelier’s principle help in maximizing the yields of products
in industrial production?
Many industrial reactions are reversible reactions. The Haber and contact processes
provide excellent illustrations of the effects of temperature, pressure and catalyst on
the equilibrium systems.
A Haber process (the industrial production of ammonia). In the Haber
process, ammonia (NH3) is industrially manufactured using gaseous nitrogen
and hydrogen.
N2(g) + 3H2 
Fe
Catalyst
YZZ ZZZXZ 2NH3(g); ∆H = – 92 kJ/mol
High yield of ammonia is produced by decreasing the temperature and
increasing the pressure of the system.
However, the yield per unit time is highly increased by using an iron catalyst.
B Contact process (the industrial production of sulphuric acid). Similarly, in
the contact process, sulphuric acid (H2
SO4) is commercially manufactured by
the reaction of SO2 and O2. The resulting SO3 is then converted to H2SO4.
