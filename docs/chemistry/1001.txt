The common feature of organic compounds is that they all contain the element carbon. 
Organic compounds are the compounds of carbon found in and derived from plants
and animals. They also include those substances synthesized in laboratories except 
the oxides of carbon, carbonates, hydrogen carbonates, cyanides and cyanates.
Besides carbon, these compounds contain a few other elements such as hydrogen, 
oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, halogens and phosphorus. The branch of chemistry that 
studies carbon compounds is called organic chemistry. This branch of chemistry 
was developed, starting from the theory of ‘life force’ to the era in which synthetic
organic compounds are used in our daily lives. The number of inorganic compounds
discovered and prepared may be in the region of some hundred thousand.At present,
millions of organic compounds have been discovered, synthesized, and used.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10

The main reason for the presence of millions of carbon compounds is the unique 
property of carbon called catenation. Catenation is the ability of atoms of the same 
element to join together forming short or long chains and rings. A few other elements 
like sulphur, silicon and boron show this behaviour, but to a much lesser extent.

Organic compounds are generally classified based on their functional group.
What are functional groups and what groups of organic compounds are known 
on the basis of this classification? 
The functional group is the part of a molecule or a compound that determines 
the chemical properties of that molecule or compound. This group also determines 
some of the physical properties of a compound. Based on the functional groups they 
possess, the most common classification of organic compounds including alkanes,
alkenes, alkynes, aromatics, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters. 
The common functional groups of some organic compounds are given in Table 1.1.

Discuss with your group and present it to the class.
What are hydrocarbons and on what basis do we categorize them? 
Hydrocarbons are organic compounds composed of the elements carbon and hydrogen 
only. Hydrocarbons are subdivided into two groups, based on the type of bonding
between carbon atoms, as saturated hydrocarbons and unsaturated hydrocarbons. 
Saturated Hydrocarbons are those compounds of carbon and hydrogen containing only 
carbon-carbon single bonds. Methane, ethane, and propane are typical examples of 
this group. Unsaturated Hydrocarbons are those compounds of carbon and hydrogen 
possessing one or more multiple bonds (double or triple bonds) between carbon 
atoms. Alkenes, alkynes and aromatic hydrocarbons are examples of unsaturated 
hydrocarbons. 
A formula that shows all the bonds and atoms is called a detailed structure. The 
shorter structure is called condensed structure.

Draw a graph using the information in Table 1.2 by plotting the number of carbon atoms 
of each compound on one axis, and hydrogen atoms on the other. Predict the formulas of 
the saturated hydrocarbons containing 8, 9 and 10 carbon atoms and complete Table 1.2. 
Discuss with your group and present it to the class. 
Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons. They contain chains of carbon atoms linked by single 
bonds only. Every carbon atom in the molecule forms four single covalent bonds with
other atoms. Alkanes have the general formula Cn
H2n+2, where, n = 1, 2, 3 . . . Using this 
general formula, we can write the molecular formula of any alkane containing a specific
number of carbon atoms. For example, the chemical formulas of alkanes containing one, 
two and three carbon atoms are C1
H2×1+2 = CH4
, C2
H2×2 + 2 =C2
H6
, and C3
H2×3 + 2 =C3

respectively.
When we compare the formulas of CH4
 and C2

H6 and C3

, they differ by one 
carbon and two hydrogen atoms or – CH2 – group called the methylene group. A group of 
compounds in which each member of the group differs from the next member by a–CH2
, is 
called a homologous series. Compounds in the same homologous series can be represented 
bythe samegeneralformula.The individualmembersofthegroupare calledhomologues.

1. What happens to the percentage by mass of hydrogen and the physical state of 
alkanes as the number of carbon atoms increase?
2. Categorize the petroleum related products you encounter everyday as solids, liquids 
and gases? Discuss in your group and present it to the class.
1.2.2 Physical Properties of Alkanes
Do you know which alkanes exist in the liquid, solid or gaseous state at room 
temperature? What types of intermolecular forces of attraction exist between the 
molecules of alkanes? Explain why the boiling points and melting points of alkanes 
increase with increasing number of carbon atoms. 
At room temperature, the first four alkanes, methane to butane, are gases; whereas
pentane (C5
H12) to heptadecane (C17H36) are liquids, and the alkanes containing 
eighteen and more carbon atoms are solids. 
Alkanes are nonpolar organic compounds. Weak intermolecular forces called Van der
Waal’s forces hold their molecules together. The strength of these forces increases with the 
Activity 1.5
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
10
increasing surface area (molecular mass) of the alkanes. Since alkanes are non-polar, 
they are almost insoluble in polar solvents like water, but, they are soluble in nonpolar solvents like benzene, toluene, ether and carbon tetrachloride.
The density, melting point, and boiling point of the homologous series of alkanes 
increase as the carbon number increases. For alkanes of the same carbon number, 
branched-chain isomers have lower boiling points than the straight-chain (normal) 
alkanes. The reason is, as branching increases, there is a decrease in surface area 
and the strength of the intermolecular force, which, in turn, results in a decrease in 
boiling point; e.g., the boiling points of n-pentane, iso-pentane and neo-pentane are
36°C, 28°C and 9.5°C, respectively. 
Alkanes containing all the carbon atoms in one continuous chain are called normal 
or straight-chain alkanes and those containing chains with branches are known as 
branched-chain alkanes.
Example
In alkanes (branched or straight-chain) each carbon atom is tetrahedrally bonded to 
four atoms with a bond angle of 109.5°.

of the rules you know for naming organic compounds and present it to your class. 
2. In mathematics, the names pentagon, hexagon, heptagon and octagon are used to 
describe polygons. What does each of the prefixes- pent, -hex, -hept and -oct indicate? 
What is the significance of these prefixes in chemistry? Discuss in groups and present 
it to the class.
1.2.3 Nomenclature (naming) of Alkanes 
Organic chemistry uses a simplified and systematic way of naming organic 
compounds. The names of alkanes and most of the organic compounds are derived
from: 
i) a prefix- indicating the number of carbon atoms (listed in Table 1.3)and
ii)a -suffix indicating the type of the functional group present in the molecule.
The following table introduces the prefixes that are used to indicate the presence of
one to ten carbon atoms in the longest continuous carbon chain.
 Table 1.3 Prefixes commonly used to indicate one to ten carbon atoms. 
Prefix Number of carbon atoms Prefix Number of carbon atoms
Meth- One Hex- Six 
Eth- Two Hept- Seven 
Prop- Three Oct- Eight 
But- Four Non- Nine 
Pent- Five Dec- Ten 
From Table 1.2, you can note that the names of all alkanes contain the suffix ‘-ane’, which 
indicates that their functional group is a carbon — carbon single bond. Thus, to name an 
Activity 1.6
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
12
alkane, you should use the appropriate prefix thatindicatesthe number of carbon atoms and
the suffix ‘-ane’. For example, to name the alkane C6
H14, use the prefix ‘Hex’ that indicate 
thepresence ofsix carbon atoms and addthe suffix ‘-ane’ so that the name becomes hexane. 
Practice naming alkanes using first four prefixes mentioned in Table 1.3. In naming 
alkanes, why are number of carbon atoms used as prefixes? Discuss in groups.
Common Names of Alkanes 
Lower members of the alkane homologousseries have common names. The prefixes
used in the common names are n- (normal), ‘iso-’ and ‘neo-’. The prefix n- is used 
when all the carbon atoms form a continuous chain. 
Example
H C — CH — CH — CH — CH 3 2 2 2 3
H C — CH — CH — CH — CH — CH 3 2 2 2 2 3
n-pentane
n-hexane
Iso- is used when all of the carbon atoms form a continuous chain, except for the 
one next to the last carbon. 
Example
H C — CH — CH 3 3 H C — CH — CH — CH 32 3
CH3 CH3
Isobutane Isopentane
Neo- is used when the central carbon is bonded to four other carbon atoms.

IUPAC System of Nomenclature of Alkanes 
It is difficult to have common names for the more branched and complex alkanes.
In naming such alkanes, the more systematic, convenient and appropriate one is the
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) system. In order to
apply this system, it is very important to know the rules to be followed, what alkyl
radicals are, and how they are named. 
Alkyl radicals are obtained by removing one hydrogen atom from the corresponding
alkanes. Their general formula is Cn
H2n+1, where n = 1, 2, 3 . . . . The names of alkyl 
radicals are derived from the names of the corresponding parent alkanes by changing
the suffix -ane to -yl.

The system of naming organic compoundsis based on the recommendations of IUPAC.
The following are the rules established by IUPACto name branched-chain hydrocarbons.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10

 1. Select the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule as the 
parent structure. The name of the straight-chain alkane possessing the same 
number of carbon atoms is used as the name of this longest chain. The groups 
attached to the parent structure are called side chains or substituents. 
Example 1

	 There are seven carbon atoms in the longest chain (the parent structure). 
Therefore, it gets the name “heptane”. 
2. Assign numbers to the carbon atoms of the longest chain starting from one 
end to the other so that the carbon atoms to which side chains are attached get 
the lowest possible number.

 To check which direction of numbering is correct; add the locants (numbers 
assigned to the carbon atoms to which substituents are attached).
	 	 The sum of locantsin the first case is 3 + 4 = 7 and in the second case, 4 + 5 = 9. So
numberingshouldbedonefromlefttorightinthiscase.Thus,thefirstoptioniscorrect.
3. Indicate the position of the side chain by using the number assigned to the carbon 
atom to which it is attached. If the same substituents appear more than once, use the 
INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
15
prefix di-, tri-, tetra- etc. before the name of the substituent to show two, three, 
four, etc. substituents, respectively.
4. Numbers are separated from each other by commas while they are separated 
from substituent names by hyphens. 
5. Arrange the names of the side chains before the parent name in alphabetical 
order. The complete name of the alkane given in the above example will then
be 4-ethyl-3-methylheptane (substituents in alphabetical order).

The longest chain has six carbon atoms and the parent name is hexane. There are 
two methyl groups at carbon-2 and another two methyl groups on carbon-4 and one 
chlorine atom at carbon-3. Therefore, the correct name of the compound is 3-chloro2,2,4,4-tetramethylhexane.

The longest chain contains eight carbon atoms. Hence, the parent name of the given
molecule is octane. There are three methyl groups attached to carbon number 3, 4 and 6;
one bromine atom is attached to carbon-4 and two chlorine atoms are attached to carbon-3 
and carbon-5. Thus, the correct name of the compound is 4-bromo-3,5-dichloro-3,4,6-
trimethyloctane.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10

Note:
When F, Cl, Br and I appear as substituents, change the names fluorine, chlorine,
bromine and iodine to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo, respectively.

or more carbon atoms have more than one structure. The existence of two or more
chemical compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures is 
called isomerism.
The compounds that have the same molecular formula but different structures
are called isomers. Alkanes exhibit a type of structural isomerism called chain or 
skeletal isomerism. These structures differ in the arrangement of the carbon atoms 
and hydrogen atoms. To understand what isomers are, consider the isomers of butane 
(C4

Methane can be produced in a biogas plant. The biogas plant generates biogas, mainly 
consisting of methane by anaerobic fermentation of organic materials such as human 
excreta, animal dung and agricultural residue. 
The conversion of organic materials into biogas involves a sequence of reactions
and is graphically depicted in Figure 1.4.

1.2.6 Chemical Properties of Alkanes 
Discuss the following points in groups and present your opinions to the class. 
1. Which chemical property of alkanes is responsible for generating electricity in diesel 
power stations or for moving motor vehicles? Name the major product formed when 
the fuel has been consumed in the diesel power station.
2. The reaction of methane with oxygen produces two different oxides of carbon, CO2
 and 
CO. 
1 What condition determines whether the product of the methane reaction is CO2
 or CO? 
b If a domestic heating system is fuelled by methane, what difference does it make 
if the combustion produces CO2
 or CO?
Alkanes are generally not considered to be very reactive organic compounds. The
name paraffin for alkanes arose from two Latin words ‘parum’ meaning little and 
‘affinis’ means affinity. Thus, paraffin means little affinity. This name was suggested
because alkanes are inert towards many reagents like acids, bases, oxidizing and 
reducing agents. However, they undergo several reactions undersuitable conditions.
The major reactions of alkanes are the following:
1. Combustion Reactions: If alkanes are burned with limited supply of oxygen, 
they will form water and carbon monoxide and will liberate lesser amounts of 
heat energy. Alkanes burn in excess oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water, 
liberating a greater amounts of heat. The general equation for the reaction is:
 Cn
H2n+2 + O2
 ® nCO2
 + (n + 1) H2
O + heat 
 where n is the number of carbon atoms in the alkane molecule.
Example 
 C3
H8
 + 5O2
 ® 3CO2
 + 4H2
O + 2299 kJ 
	 	 The heat energy liberated is used to generate electricity, to move motor vehicles
or to cook our food.

1. Write the general equation for the combustion of alkanes in a limited supply of 
oxygen that forms carbon monoxide, water and energy.
2. Why is a petroleum refinery is built in the open air? Present your opinion to the class.
2. Substitution Reaction: Thisis a reaction that involvesthe replacement of one
atom or a group of atoms by another atom or group of atoms. Halogenation 
of alkanes is a very good example of substitution reaction. This reaction
involvesreacting alkanes with chlorine and bromine. The reaction of chlorine
and bromine with alkanes proceeds in presence of heat or sunlight. This type 
of reaction is called photochemical reaction. The reaction of alkanes with 
chlorine and bromine proceeds in a sequence of steps. For example, let us 
consider the photochemical reaction of methane with chlorine (chlorination): 
i) Chain Initiating Step: This step involves absorption of energy to generate
reactive particles known as free radicals. A free radical is an atom or a 
group of atoms possessing unpaired electron. A free radical is electrically neutral. 
A chlorine molecule absorbs light and decomposes into two chlorine atoms:

 ii) Chain Propagating Step:Thisisastepwhichconsumesareactiveparticle(free 
radical) produced in the chain initiation step and generates another free radical. 
 
 iii) Chain Terminating Step:Inthechainterminatingstepreactiveparticles(free 
radicals) are consumed but not generated. 
 
 In this step, ‘side reactions’ that do not lead to the formation of the desired 
products often take place.

 Such a detailed step by step description of a chemical reaction is called a reaction 
mechanism.

Alkanes do not react with chlorine and bromine in the dark but they do so in the 
presence of sunlight. Discuss the role of sunlight for the reaction in your group and 
present to the class.
3. Elimination reaction: This type of reaction involves the removal of smaller
molecules from a compound and leads to the formation of a compound 
containing a multiple bond (unsaturated compound). It can also involve the
removal of hydrogen atoms from adjacent carbon atoms at relatively high
temperatures.

names are obtained by prefixing “cyclo” to the name of an alkane containing the same
number of carbon atoms. The following structures represent some examples of cycloalkanes.

Physical Properties of Alkenes
1. Why some alkenes exist in gaseous and liquid states at room temperature?
2. The melting points, boiling points and densities of alkenes increase with increasing 
number of carbon atoms; why?
3. Are alkenes coloured compounds? Do they have smell?
Discuss with your group and present it to the class.
At room temperature, alkenes containing two to four carbon atoms are gases. Those 
containing five to seventeen carbon atoms are liquids, and those containing eighteen
or more carbon atoms are solids. 
Alkenes are non-polar. Therefore, their molecules are held together by weak intermolecular forces. Since they are non-polar, they are almost insoluble in polarsolvents
like water, but soluble in non-polar solvents like ether, benzene, toluene and carbon
tetrachloride.
Nomenclature of Alkenes 
Alkenes can have common names as well as IUPAC names. The common names of
alkenes are obtained by using the prefixesin Table 1.3 and adding the suffix ‘-ylene’:

the hydrocarbon shown in structure ii?
d Is there any difference in how you assign number to the carbon atoms of the 
longest chain represented by structures i and ii? If so, why?
e Which name do you think is more appropriate for the longest chain of carbon 
atoms in structure ii? 5-hexene or 1-hexene or hexane? Discuss these questions in 
your group and present to the class.
The IUPAC names of alkenes are obtained by using the prefixes listed in Table 1.3
to indicate the number of carbon atoms in the molecule and adding the suffix ‘-ene’. 
The suffix ‘-ene’ indicates the presence of a double bond. For example, the alkene
having the formula C8
H16 is named as octene. The prefix oct- indicates that there are 
eight carbon atoms in the molecule and ‘-ene’signifiesthe presence of a double bond.
In the IUPAC system of naming alkenes, the rules we follow are similar to those
rules we follow for naming alkanes with slight modifications. These are:
1. Select the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule that 
includes the double bond as a parent structure. Its name will be the same as 
the alkene containing the same number of carbon atoms.

 i)
Why should the double bond(s) in alkenes be included in the longest continuous chain? 
Express your opinion to the class.
Activity 1.17
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10

2. Number the carbon atoms starting from one end to the other in such a way that 
the carbon atom preceding the double bond takes the lowest possible number 
and indicate the position of the double bond by this number in the name. 
Example 1

CH3 
 The longest chain contains 7 carbon atoms and a double bond between the 2nd 
and 3rd carbon atoms. Therefore, it takes the name 2-heptene or hept-2-ene. 
There are three methyl groups at carbon number 3, 4 and 5. So the complete 
name of the compound is: 
 3, 4, 5-trimethyl-2-heptene or 3, 4, 5-trimethyl hept-2-ene

	 The parentstructure contains 8 carbon atoms and a double bond between 3rd and 
4th carbon atoms. Thus, it is named as 3-octene or oct-3-ene. The side chains 
attached are chlorine at the 6th, two methyl groups at 5th and 6th and an ethyl group 
at carbon number 3. Therefore, the complete name of the compound is: 
 6-chloro-3-ethyl-5,6-dimethyl-3-octene, or 
 6-chloro-3-ethyl-5,6-dimethyloct-3-ene.

Isomerism in Alkenes 
Alkenes containing two and three carbon atoms have only one possible structure.
Alkenes containing four or more carbon atoms exhibit isomerism. Alkenes show the 
following three types of isomerism: 
1. Chain isomerism: This is due to the difference in the arrangement of the 
carbon atoms in the longest continuous carbon chain. 
2. Position isomerism: This is due to the difference in the position of the double 
bond in the carbon chain. 
Example 
Consider the following compounds with the same molecular formula (C5
H12):

Compounds (a) and (b) represent the position isomers of pentene, (c) and (d) 
are position isomers of methylbutene, (a), (c) and (e) are the chain isomers, 
while all these compounds are the isomers of C5
H12.
3. Geometrical isomerism. Thisresultsfrom the difference in the relative spatial
arrangement of atoms or groups about the double bond. This isomerism exists 
because free rotation about the double bond is not possible. To differentiate 
geometrical isomers, we use the prefix ‘cis’ if two similar groups are on the 
same side of the double bond and ‘trans’ when the two similar groups are on 
opposite sides of it; ‘cis’ means the same and ‘trans’ means across. 
 The geometrical isomers of 2-pentene are: 
	 Alkenes have more isomers than the corresponding alkanes.

Chemical properties of Alkenes
Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons containing double bond (a strong bond and 
a weak bond) between the two carbon atoms. They are more reactive than alkanes,
because the weak bond can be used for further reaction. They undergo several types
of reactions.
1. Combustion reaction.Alkenes burn in oxygen with a luminous flame to form
carbon dioxide and water.
 General reaction: Cn
H2n
 + O2
 ® nCO2
 + nH2
O + heat 
Example
 C4
H8
(g) + 6O2
 (g) ® 4CO2 (g) + 4 H2
O (g) + heat
2. Addition reaction. Alkenes undergo mainly addition reactions. The addition 
occurs at the carbon-carbon double bond. 
 a Addition of halogens (halogenation): When a halogen molecule, X2
, (where, 
X2
 = Cl2
 or Br2
) is added to alkenes, the product is a dihaloalkane. 
 General reaction:
 
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
38
Example
 If bromine water (bromine in CCl4
) is added to alkenes, the reddish brown 
colour of Br2
 in CCl4
 will disappear. This is due to the addition of bromine 
(Br2
) across the double bond. So, Br2
 in CCl4
 is used to detect unsaturation 
(presence of multiple bond) in a compound. 
 b Addition of hydrogen (Hydrogenation): Addition of hydrogen molecule to 
alkenes in the presence of a nickel or platinum catalyst yields alkanes. 
 General reaction: CH == CH + H R – CH – CH Pt R – 2 2 2 3
Alkene Alkane
Example
Ethene
Pt
Ethane
c Addition of hydrogen halides, HX (hydrohalogenation):Addition of hydrogen 
halide (HCl, HBr or HI) to alkenes leads to the formation of alkyl halides. The 
product of the reaction can be predicted by Markovnikov’srule; which states
that “when an alkene reacts with a hydrogen halide to give an alkyl halide, the
hydrogen adds to the carbon atom of the double bond that has the greater 
number of hydrogen atoms, and the halogen to the carbon that has the fewer 
number of hydrogen atoms”. 
The same is true when an alkene reacts with water in an addition reaction to 
form an alcohol.

rule.

molecules called monomers to form a large molecule called a polymer. 
Example
Uses of Ethene (Ethylene)
	Ethene is used in the production of ethanol, and polymers such as polyethene,
	polyvinylchloride (PVC), polystyrene and teflon. It is also used in the production
	of 1,2-ethanediol, which is used as an antifreeze material; and for the preservation
	as well as artificial ripening of fruits.
Take some green tomatoes in first basket and put a ripe banana in between them. In a 
second basket put only green tomatoes (but not a banana). Compare the tomatoes in the 
two baskets. Do the tomatoes ripen at the same rate in both baskets; if not, why? Share 
your opinion with your classmates.
Cycloalkenes 
Cycloalkenes are unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons. The carbon atoms are linked in such a 
manner as to form a closed chain or a ring structure. They contain a double bond between 
carbon atoms and are represented by the general formula Cn
H2n–2, where n should be 
equal to or greater than 3. They are isomeric with alkynes. They are named by prefixing
“cyclo” to the name of alkenes containing the same number of carbon atoms. The given
structures show some examples of cycloalkenes. 
The IUPAC names for alkynes are obtained by using the prefixes listed in Table 1.3. The 
suffix ‘-yne’is added to the prefixes, which indicatesthe presence of a triple bond between
a pair of adjacent carbon atoms. Alkynes are named in the same way as alkenes.

Physical Properties of Alkynes 
Alkynes are non-polar compounds whose molecules are held together by weak 
intermolecular forces. The strength of the intermolecular forces increases with 
increasing molecular size. The physical properties of alkynes are almost similar to 
those of alkenes.

present to the class.
Nomenclature of Alkynes 
Alkynes are commonly named as a derivative of acetylene. 
Example
IUPAC System: The IUPAC names for alkynes are obtained by using the prefixes listed 
in Table 1.3. The suffix ‘-yne’ is added to the prefixes. ‘-yne’ indicate the presence of a 
triple bond between a pair of adjacent carbon atoms. Alkynes are named in the same way 
as alkenes.

Chemical Properties of Alkynes
Alkynes are more reactive than alkanes and alkenes. Why? 
Alkynes are more unsaturated than alkanes and alkenes due to the presence of a 
carbon-carbon triple bond. They can undergo combustion and addition reactions. 
Some of the common reactions of alkynes are:
1. Combustion reaction: Alkynes burn with a smoky luminous flame, forming 
CO2 and water. Smoky luminous flames result from the combustion of alkynes 
due to their high carbon content. 
 General reaction: CnH2n–2 + 
3 – 1

 O2 ® nCO2 + (n – 1) H2O 
Example

2. Addtion reaction: Alkynes undergo addition reaction at the carbon-carbon 
triple bond. Some of the addition reactions of alkynes are the following:
 a Addition of hydrogen (hydrogenation): In the presence of nickel or 
palladium catalyst, alkynes produce alkanes.

1.3.3 Properties and uses of Acetylene or Ethyne 
Acetylene is a colourless, sweet-smelling gas in pure form and is insoluble in water. It is 
usually stored as a solution of acetone in steel cylinders. Combustion of acetylene with 
oxygen produces an intensely hot flame of about 3000o
C. Thus, a large quantity of acetylene 
is used as a fuel in oxy-acetylene torches for cutting and welding metals. Acetylene is also 
used to prepare acrylonitrile which is a starting material for producing polyacrylonitrile, a 
raw material for textile fibre. It is also used for making vinyl chloride which polymerizes to

1.4 AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS 
Competencies 
At the end of this section you will be able to: 
• define the term aromatic hydrocarbons; 
• draw the structure of benzene;
• describe the main physical properties of benzene;
• explain the chemical reactions of benzene;
• carry out test-tube reactions with Br2 in CCl4, KMnO4, concentrated H2SO4.
Discuss the following in your group and present it to the class:
1. What comes to your mind when you hear the word “benzene”? 
2. What is the word “aroma” mean? Which substances have an aroma smell? 
3. Are aromatic hydrocarbons unsaturated as alkenes? Why?
The term aromatic is derived from the word ‘aroma’ meaning pleasant smell, which 
was originally used to describe naturally occurring compounds with pleasant smells. 
At present, the term is used without its original significance. Aromatic hydrocarbons 
are generally obtained from petroleum and coal tar. They are a group of hydrocarbons 
characterized by the presence of a benzene ring or related structures. Some examples of 
aromatic hydrocarbon structures are given below:

1.4.1 Benzene 
Benzene is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon. Its molecular formula is C6H6. 
Friedrich A. Kekule, in 1865, suggested that the six carbon atoms of benzene are 
arranged in the shape of a hexagon. He also suggested a resonance hybrid structure. 
He represented benzene by the resonance structures (Figure 1.10) in which the two 
structures shown make equal contribution for the resonance hybrid or actual structure.

The bonds in benzene are neither single nor double but have an intermediate character 
between those of single and double bonds. All the carbon-carbon bonds in the molecule 
are same in length and nature. Since structure I or II given above are not the true structures 
of the benzene molecule, the benzene ring is written, in most cases, in its resonance hybrid 
form as follows:
 
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
52
The six electrons in the hexagonal ring are delocalized.
From structures I and II in Figure 1.10, one may think that benzene has three double 
bonds and has the same chemistry as that of alkenes. But, this is not true. Benzene 
and other aromatic hydrocarbons are not as unsaturated as alkenes because the three 
double bonds in benzene are delocalized due to resonance. They are more stable than 
alkenes. They undergo substitution reactions to a far greater extent than addition 
reactions, which is a different characteristic compared to alkenes.
Physical Properties of Benzene
Benzene is a flammable, colourless, and volatile liquid with a characteristic smell. It 
is nonpolar and immiscible with water but miscible with non-polar solvents like ether 
and carbon tetrachloride. It freezes at 5.4oC and boils at 80.4oC. It is a carcinogenic 
(cancer causing) substance. Benzene is a good solvent for fats, gums, rubber etc., 
and is used in the manufacture of dyes, drugs and explosives. 
Chemical Properties of Benzene
Benzene and other aromatic hydrocarbons are more stable than alkenes and alkynes 
due to the stability of the aromatic ring. It neither decolorizes bromine water (Br2
in CCl4) nor is reactive towards cold potassium permanganate solution. However, 
benzene undergoes the following reactions:
1. Combustion reaction: Benzene is highly inflammable. It burns with a smoky 
luminous flame to form CO2 and H2O.
 2C6H6 + 15O2 ® 12CO2 + 6H2O + Heat
2. Substitution reaction: The reactions of benzene are chiefly substitution but 
not addition reactions. In this reaction, hydrogen atom from the benzene ring 
is replaced by another atom or group. 
 a Halogenation: Benzene reacts with bromine and chlorine in the presence of 
iron (III) chloride or aluminium chloride catalyst to form substitution products.

• describe natural gas;
• define crude oil;
• explain the fractional distillation of crude oil;
• mention the products of the fractional distillation of crude oil;

Discuss the following in your group and present it to the class:
1. What do you think is the major component of natural gas?
2. How can petroleum be separated into different fractions? 
3. How are natural gas, petroleum and coal formed in nature? Can they be recycled? 
A. Natural Gas
The principal sources of hydrocarbons are natural gas, crude oil and coal. Natural gas 
is found in association with petroleum or alone. It is found in underground deposits 
several hundreds or thousands of metres below the earth’s surface, where it originated 
from the decay and decomposition of animal and plant remains millions of years ago. 
Natural gas mainly contains methane (more than 90%), ethane, propane, butane and 
small quantities of higher alkanes. Other gases such as, CO2, N2, O2 and H2S, may 
also be present in natural gas. The composition of natural gas varies, depending on its 
place of origin. Natural gas is widely used as a fuel. It is advantageous over liquid and 
solid fuels and also other gases, except H2, due to its very high heat of combustion.
B. Petroleum
The word petroleum is derived from two Latin words, ‘petra’ meaning rock, and 
‘oleum’ meaning oil. Thus, petroleum means rock oil. The term petroleum refers to 
a broad range of fossil hydrocarbons that are found as gases, liquids or solids beneath 
the surface of the earth. The crude oil is generally found along with natural gas in the 
form of a dark-coloured viscous liquid, which is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. 
Its composition varies according to its place of origin. However, crude oil mainly 
contains alkanes, cycloalkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. It also contains organic 
compounds consisting of nitrogen, sulphur and oxygen in small amounts. 
Refining of Crude Oil
Crude oil or petroleum is obtained by drilling wells until the oil-bearing region is reached. 
After the crude oil is brought to the surface of the earth, it must be refined before it 
can be used. 
Crude oil is refined or separated into several components by fractional distillation 
based on the differences in boiling ranges of its fractions. (Figure 1.11).

Most hydrocarbons present in petroleum are long-chain hydrocarbons. However, there is a 
very high demand for petrol or gasoline, which contains hydrocarbons, composed of five 
to ten carbon atoms. Therefore, the amount of petrol obtained by fractional distillation of 
crude oil does not satisfy the demand for it. To satisfy the demand and maximize the output 
of petrol or gasoline, the process called cracking is carried out during fractional distillation.
What does cracking mean? Cracking is the decomposition of large hydrocarbon 
molecules into smaller ones by the application of heat (thermal cracking or pyrolysis) 
or in the presence of catalysts (catalytic cracking). 
Example

Hexadecane Octane Octene
Hydrogen gas can be added during cracking to saturate the alkenes formed in the 
process.
C. Coal
Coal is formed naturally by the decomposition of plant matter over several millions of 
years. It is not a pure form of carbon. It is an important source of aromatic hydrocarbons. 
Heating mineral coal in the absence of air, or oxygen is called destructive distillation of 
coal or coking of coal. When coal is heated in the absence of air it gives volatile products 
and coke. The volatile products separate into coal gas and a liquid, called coal tar when 
cooled. Aromatic hydrocarbons and many other substances are isolated from coal tar by 
fractional distillation.
Coke, which is a solid and relatively pure form of carbon, is used as a fuel in the blast 
furnace during the extraction of iron. It is also used to produce gaseous fuels, such as 
water gas (mixture of H2 and CO) and producer gas (mixture of N2 and CO).

What do you think when you hear the word “alcohol”?Can you define alcohol? Give a 
few examples of the uses of alcohols. Most people think of two common alcohols- the 
substance that intoxicates people and the one used in clinics and hospitals. However, 
there are many types of alcohol. The only alcohol present in all alcoholic beverages 
is called ethanol. Other alcohols are used for different purposes.
Alcohols are hydroxyl derivatives of hydrocarbons that can be obtained by replacing 
one or more hydrogen atom(s) of a hydrocarbon with the hydroxyl (–OH) group. 
The hydroxyl group is the functional group of alcohols.

1.6.1 Classification of Alcohols
Alcohols are generally classified as monohydric, dihydric and trihydric depending on the 
number of hydroxyl (–OH) groups they contain in their molecular structure.
Monohydric alcohols are alcohols containing only one hydroxyl group.
Examples
Dihydric alcohols are those containing two hydroxyl groups per molecule. They are also 
named glycols or diols. 
Example
Trihydric alcohols are those containing three hydroxyl groups in their molecular structure.
Polyhydric alcohols are those containing three or more hydroxyl groups in their 
molecular structure. Trihydric alcohols are also considered as polyhydric alcohols.
Example
1.6.2 Nomenclature of Alcohols
An alcohol can be considered to be derived from a hydrocarbon by the replacement of at 
least one H atom by hydroxyl group. Hence, alcohols can be systematically named by 
using the suffix -ol to replace the terminal -e in the corresponding alkane name.

Based on the structural formulas given in table 1.10, derive the general formula for the 
homologous series of monohydric alcohols. Discuss in your group and present to the class.
In the IUPAC system of nomenclature of alcohols containing side chains or –OH 
groups in different positions, the longest chain to which the –OH group is attached, 
is chosen as a parent structure. The chain is then numbered, starting from the end 
closer to the carbon atom to which the –OH group is bonded. The other rules are 
similar to the nomenclature of hydrocarbons.
Examples
 
Classification of Monohydric Alcohols
Carbon atoms can be classified as primary (1°), secondary (2°), tertiary (3°) and quaternary 
(4°) if they are bonded to one, two, three and four carbon atoms, respectively.

Activity 1.28
1. Why do alcohols have higher boiling points than the corresponding hydrocarbons?
2. Why boiling points of dihydric and trihydric alcohols are higher than those of 
monohydric alcohols of comparable molecular size? 
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10

3. Lower alcohols, like methanol and ethanol, are miscible with water in all proportions, 
while lower hydrocarbons are not so. Explain.
4. Based on the boiling point of water, H2O, and methanol, CH3OH, in which one would 
you expect to observe a greater degree of hydrogen bonding? Explain. Discuss with 
your group and present to the class.
The hydroxyl group in an alcohol is polar due to the high electronegativity of oxygen. 
As a result, there is significant hydrogen bonding in alcohols. 
Figure 1.12 Hydrogen bonding between molecules of an alcohol.
Due to the hydrogen bonding in alcohols, they have higher melting and boiling points 
than hydrocarbons of comparable molecular size (mass). Hydrogen bonding is also 
the cause for even lower members to be liquids at room temperature. The boiling 
point of more branched isomer is lower than that of its isomeric straight-chain alcohol. 
For Example: CH3CH2CH2CH2OH, boils at 117.7°C, while 
boils at 82.5°C. Dihydric and the trihydric alcohols have higher boiling points than 
monohydric alcohols of similar molecular size (mass). Ethane-1,2-diol (dihydric alcohol, 
molecular mass = 62), boils at 197°C, while 1-propanol (monohydric, molecular mass 
= 60) boils at 97.2°C. 
The first three alcohols, methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol are miscible with water in all 
proportions, while the solubility in water decreases with increasing carbon number. The 
water solubilities of dihydric and trihydric alcohols are higher than those of monohydric 
alcohols of similar molecular mass.

Activity 1.29
1 How do the local people in Ethiopia prepare alcoholic beverages like “Tella”, “Tej” and 
“Katikalla”? What raw materials and apparatus do they use?
2 Which industrial method of production of ethanol is more or less similar to the 
method followed by the local people? Share your ideas with your class.
Ethanol is the second member of the homologous series of monohydric alcohols. 
It is one of the constituents of all alcoholic beverages. ‘Tella’, ‘Tej’, beer, wine, 
‘Katikalla’, ouzo, gin and whisky contain ethanol. There are a number of methods 
for preparing ethanol using different materials.
Industrial preparation of Ethanol
Ethanol is manufactured industrially by:
1. Fermentation of carbohydrates such as sugar: Fermentation is the slow 
decomposition of carbohydrates such as sucrose, starch and cellulose in the 
presence of suitable enzyme, that results in the formation of ethanol and 
carbon dioxide:
 
C H O + H O C H O + C H 12 22 11 2 6 12 6 6 12 6 O invertase
Sucrose Glucose Fructose
C H O 2CH CH OH + 2C 6 12 6 3 2 O2
Glucose Ethanol
 Fermentation can produce an alcoholic beverage whose ethanol content is 
12 – 15% only. The alcohol kills the yeast and inhibits its activity when 
the percentage is higher. To produce beverages of higher ethanol content, 
distillation of the aqueous solution is required. 
 Most liquor factories in Ethiopia use molasses, a by-product of sugar industries, 
as a raw material to produce ethanol. In the brewing industry, germinated barley 
called malt (in Amharic, ‘Bikil’) is used as the starting material. The whole 
process taking place in breweries is summarized as follows:

2. Catalytic Hydration of Ethene: Most ethanol is manufactured at present by this 
method. In this process, ethene is treated with steam at 573 K and 60 atm pressures 
in the presence of phosphoric acid, H3PO4, catalyst.
 
Preparation of Ethanol by Fermentation

Properties and Uses of Ethanol
Ethanol is a colourless liquid with a pleasant smell and a burning taste. It boils at 78.3°C and 
freezes at –117°C. It is inflammable and burns with a blue flame. It is miscible with water in 
all proportions, non-poisonous and has an intoxicating effect. It is a hypnotic (sleep producer). 
Ethanol is a constituent of all alcoholic beverages. It is a good solvent for many organic 
compounds that are insoluble in water, such as paints, dyes, perfumes etc. It is also used 
as a fuel for cars and spirit lamps, and to make denatured alcohol which is a mixture of 
ethanol and other poisonous substance that has been added to make the alcohol unfit for 
drinking. For example, methylated spirit is a mixture of 95% ethanol and 5% methanol.
• Currently, Ethiopia uses 5% ethanol with 95% benzene as fuel for cars.
1.6.5 Chemical Properties of Alcohols
Activity 1.30
Why alcoholic beverages such as “Tela”, “Tej”, beer and wine turn sour if they are not 
properly stored? Which reaction of alcohols is responsible for this phenomenon? Write 
a chemical equation to support your answer. Discuss with your group and present it to 
the class.
What types of reactions do alcohols undergo? Alcohols contain a hydrocarbon group and 
a functional group (–OH). Which part of alcohols is responsible for most of their chemical 
reactions? 
Reactions of alcohols may involve the cleavage of the oxygen hydrogen bond (— O — H) 
or the carbon-oxygen bond (— C — O).
The reactions of alcohols involving the –O–H bond cleavage are:
a Alcohols react with strongly electropositive metals like Na, K and Ca to form 
alkoxides and liberating H2 gas.

Reactions of Alcohols with Active Metals
Objective: To observe the reaction of alcohols with sodium and magnesium.
Materials required:Ethanol, sodium and magnesium metal. Test tubes, test tube holder, 
test tube rack, measuring cylinder, Bunsen burner, scissors or knife.
Procedure:
 Take two test tubes and add 2-5 mL of ethanol to each of the test tubes. Cut 
a very small piece of sodium with a knife and drop it into the first test tube. 
Take magnesium ribbon and drop it in the second test tube. 
Observations and analysis:
1. What do you observe: 
 a in the 1st test tube? b in the 2nd test tube?
2. Is there an evolution of gas? What do you think this gas is?
3. If no reaction occurs in any of the test tubes, heat the mixture gently using a 
Bunsen burner and write your observation.
4. Which bond of the alcohol is broken in the reaction?
5. Write a general reaction for such reactions?
6. What type of metals react in this manner?
b Oxidation of alcohols: The oxidation products of alcohols depend on the type of 
alcohol and the nature of oxidizing agents. Oxidation of alcohols is a very important 
method for the production of other oxygen-containing compounds of hydrocarbons, 
such as aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids. 
 i) Oxidation of primary alcohols in the presence of mild oxidizing agents yields 
aldehydes.

 or 
RCHO, where R is an alkyl group. In the case of methanal R = H. For naming 
aldehydes, use the suffix -al to replace the terminal -e in the corresponding 
alkane name. The suffix “-al” indicates the functional group –CHO. The names
and condensed structures of the first six aldehydes are given in Table 1.11.

General reaction: 
 
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
72
Example
The general structural formula of ketones is: or RCOR’ where R 
and R’ may be same or different. The IUPAC names of ketones are obtained 
by using the suffix -one to replace the terminal -e in the corresponding alkane 
name. The suffix ‘-one’ indicates the functional group. Unlike aldehydes, the 
position of the functional group must be indicated in the name of higher ketones. 
To do so, the longest chain containing the functional group is chosen as a parent 
structure and then the carbon atoms of the chain are numbered starting from the 
end closer to the carbonyl group. 
Examples
iii) Tertiary alcohols and ketones are generally resistant to oxidation. However, 
they can undergo oxidation under drastic conditions to form a mixture of 
carboxylic acids.

Activity 1.32
INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
79
Industrial application 
Organic chemicals are used for the manufacturing of a large number of industrial 
products that have a variety of uses. Some of these products include alcoholic beverages, 
pharmaceuticals, soaps and detergents etc.
A. Alcoholic beverages
All alcoholic beverages commonly contain the alcohol known as ethanol. The ethanol 
content of all alcoholic beverages is not the same. Some beverages contain small 
concentrations of ethanol while others contain higher concentrations. These alcoholic 
beverages can be either undistilled or distilled. The undistilled alcoholic beverages include 
beer, wine, “Tella”, ‘Tej’ etc while ouzo, gin, brandy, whisky, ‘Katikalla’, and vodka are 
among the distilled alcoholic beverages.
Beer: Beer is one of the alcoholic beverages widely manufactured and consumed in 
most parts of the world. The common raw materials for its production are barley 
and hops. Although the types of beer produced in the world are very many, the 
average beer has alcohol content between 3-6 percent by volume.
Wine: Wine is another undistilled alcoholic beverage. The most common raw material 
for producing wine are grapes. In the production process, grapes are first crushed 
and then steamed. The liquid derived from crushing is called must. It then goes to a 
fermentation tank where fermentation takes place. Then it passes to a settling tank, 
where sediments are allowed to settle, and it proceeds from there to a filter. The 
clear liquid is cooled in a refrigerator and is pasteurized as it passes through a flash 
pasteurizer. Most wines have an alcohol content varying from 10-15% by volume.
Liquor: Compared with beer and wine, liquor contains higher concentrations of ethanol. It 
is not possible to obtain an alcoholic beverage of more than 15% alcohol by volume 
through fermentations. This is because the yeast cells are not able to stay alive in 
alcohol of higher concentration. To get alcoholic beverages with higher percentages 
of alcohol, the alcohol must be separated from the solution by distillation. 
The alcoholic beverages like ouzo, gin, cognac, whisky etc, are made by distillation. 
Different types of liquors have different alcohol concentrations. In most distilled alcoholic 
beverages the percentage ranges between 30-45% alcohol by volume. However, some 
alcoholic beverages like Araki are expected to have a higher percentage of ethanol. 
B. Pharmaceuticals
Organic chemicals are used to manufacture drugs and medicines for various uses. 
These drugs and medicines are collectively known as pharmaceuticals. Some of the
pharmaceuticals are: 
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
80
Analgesics: These are substances that reduce pain. For example: aspirin and 
paracetamol.
Antiseptics: These are substances that help to prevent infections in wounds by 
killing bacteria; for example, acriflavine. 
Sedatives: These are drugs that make a person go to sleep or make them feel 
calm and relaxed. Examples of such type of medicines are the 
barbiturates, which include several important drugs. 
Disinfectants: These are substances used to disinfect something or to kill bacteria; for 
example, Dettol.
Sulphonamides: These are medicines used as antibiotics. For example: penicillin. 
C. Soaps and Detergents
Organic chemicals are used for the synthesis of soaps and detergents. For example, 
animal fat and vegetable oils are used for manufacturing soap. Fats and oils are naturally 
occurring esters of glycerol and the higher fatty acids. Long open-chain alcohols and 
alkyl benzene sulphonic acid can be used for the production of detergents.
Soaps and detergents are substances used to remove dirt. They are also called surfactants 
or surface active agents. This is because they reduce the surface tension of water and 
change the surface properties.
Soaps are either sodium or potassium salts of higher (long-chain) carboxylic acids. Soaps 
that are sodium salts are called hard soaps and those that are potassium salts are soft
soaps. Soaps are prepared by boiling animal fat or vegetable oil with a base. The reaction 
that produces soap is called saponification. 
Example
INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
81
Detergents contain either a sulfate or a sulphonate group. One example of 
detergents is sodium lauryl sulfate, C12 H25 — O — SO2 — ONa. It is prepared first 
by reacting dodecyl (lauryl) alcohol with sulphuric acid followed by reaction with 
sodium hydroxide.
The reaction equation is:

Preparation of Soap
Objective: To prepare soap from animal fat or vegetable oil.
Materials required: Animal fat or vegetable oil, NaOH, NaCl, measuring cylinder, 
beaker, glass rod, Bunsen burner, filter paper, funnel, conical flask, and 
test tube. 
Procedure:
 Measure 3 mL vegetable oil or 3 g animal fat and place it in a 100 mL beaker; add 3 mL 
of ethanol and 3 mL of 5M NaOH. Stir the mixture vigorously with a glass 
rod and gently heat over a flame for 15 minutes or until it turns in to a paste. When 
the paste begins to form, stir very carefully to prevent frothing. After all the paste has 
formed, set the beaker on the bench to cool. Add about 15 mL of saturated 
NaCl solution to the paste mixture and stir thoroughly. This process is called salting 
out the soap. Filter off the soap mixture by suction filtration and wash the collected 
soap precipitate with 15 mL of ice water. 
Observations and analysis:
a Why do we add ethanol during the preparation? 
b What is the purpose of adding saturated NaCl solution to the paste mixture? 
Write a laboratory report and present to the class.
 Experiment 1.9
CHEMISTRY GRADE 10
82
D. Dry Cleaning
The qualities of some clothes decrease when they are washed with water using ordinary 
soap. In order to avoid this, other chemicals are used for washing purposes that remove 
dirt in the same manner as soaps. Dry cleaning refers to the use of different chemicals 
that are capable of dissolving grease and other dirt stains in a similar manner as soaps 
without the use of water. The most commonly used chemicals in dry cleaning are organic 
chemicals such as tetrachloromethane, CCl4; tetrachloroethylene, Cl2C = CCl2; benzene 
and gasoline.
E. Fuels 
The term fuel refers to any material that is capable of burning to produce energy, heat and 
light. Most fuels occurring in nature are organic compounds. However, some inorganic 
substances like hydrogen, producer gas and water gas are also used as gaseous fuels. But, 
the most widely used fuels at present are of organic origin. This includes petroleum which 
chiefly contains alkanes. Natural gas which is used as a fuel for stoves contains mainly 
methane. Gasoline which is used as a fuel for internal combustion engines also contains 
alkanes. Paraffin wax which is used to make candles is another fuel to get light energy 
and it is a mixture of alkanes containing more than twenty carbon atoms. Besides its use 
as a constituent of all alcoholic beverages, ethanol can also be used as a fuel for internal 
combustion engines. At present, it is one of the substances that we can rely on for use as a 
fuel for automobiles. The use of ethanol as a fuel is now practiced in our country by mixing 
it with petrol. Ethanol and other plant seed oils can be classified as bio fuels.
Agricultural Applications 
Organic compounds also play an important role in agriculture, specially to increase crop 
productivity by controlling the damages caused by insects, rodents, fungi, birds and weeds. 
So, organic chemicals can be used in the manufacture of pesticides and herbicides. 
What is the distinction between herbicides and pesticides? 
Pesticides are the chemicals used for controlling the damage that can be caused by fungi, 
insects and other pests that attack crops. Among the pesticides, Bordeaux mixture is used as 
fungicide. Other chemicals like DDT, aldrine, dieldrine, malathion are used as insecticides. 
Herbicides are the chemicals that are applied on agricultural lands to remove unwanted 
plants or weeds. Some examples of compounds that are used as herbicides include paraquat, 
diquat, ammonium sulphamate, ammonium glyphosinate, sodium chlorate etc. 
Fertilizers: In order to increase crop productivity we use either synthetic or natural 
fertilizers. Synthetic fertilizers are grouped into three classes as nitrogen, potash and 
phosphate fertilizers. Nitrogen is one of the essential plant nutrients. It is absorbed by 
plants in the form of nitrate ion, NO–
3
 . Nitrogen enables green plants to synthesize amino 
acids and proteins, and it is also a constituent of DNA molecules. To provide nitrogen for 
INTRODUCTION TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY (UNIT 1)
83
plants, nitrogen-containing fertilizers are usually added to the soil. These include, ammonium 
salts like NH4
Cl, (NH4
)
2
SO4; nitrates like KNO3
 and urea. Urea is one of the most important 
nitrogen fertilizers. It is a component of urine. On an industrial scale, urea is manufactured 
by the dehydration of ammonium carbamate:
