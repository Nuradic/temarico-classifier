In the previous unit, you have learnt about the physical environment such as 
structure, geological events and components of the earth’s environment. This unit 
deals with population of the world and Ethiopia. You will learn about their size 
and trend of population growth, dynamics of population structure and spatial 
distribution of population, urbanization, and population policy of Ethiopia.

What factors have contributed to the growth of world population since 5000 BC, 
about 7000 years ago? 
For most of our history, human populations have been small, compared to those of 
other species. Studies of hunting and gathering societies (before 5000 BC) suggest 
that total world population was probably only a few million people. A major 
change occurred about 10,000 years ago, when humans began to domesticate 
animals. This advance led to increased food supplies, which allowed the human 
population to grow, reaching perhaps 50 million people by 5000 B.C. (See 
Table 3.1). 
However, for thousands of years, the human population increased very slowly, 
and it took more than 1,500 years to reach the 500 million mark. Growth was not 
steady, but was marked by great fluctuations dictated by climate, food supply, 
disease and war.

In your geography workgroup of three to five students, discuss the following questions.
With the help of Table 3.1 and Figure 3.1, briefly describe changes in world population 
size and growth trends over time. Consider the following important points during 
your discussion:
a The 17th century and onwards has been a period of advancement of science 
and technology. 
b Since about 1950, we have had moderate medicine costs, high-yield varieties 
of seeds, improvements in transport facilities, great declines in death rates,

3.1 SIZE AND TREND OF WORLD POPULATION GROWTH
Both Table 3.1 and Figure 3.1 show that, by 1900, world population had reached 
1.60 billion, and by 1960 it stood at 3.04 billion. 
The United Nations estimated that world population reached 6 billion with an 
annual growth rate of 1.5% by 2000 A.D. The number added to world population 
per year would increase from 80 million to 90 million if the growth rate of 1.5% 
continues, and world population would double in a period of 40-50 years from 
about 2000 A.D. Such rapid and dramatic growth rate of the world population is 
known as population explosion.

How do you calculate population doubling time? 
Population doubling time is the time taken, in years, for a population of a 
given region or country to double at a given rate of population growth. It 
can be calculated using the following formula: 
Population growth rate determines the time required for a population to double. 
The lower the growth rate, the longer is the doubling time, and the higher the 
growth rate, the shorter is the doubling time (Table 3.2).

Activity 3.2
Answer the following questions, based on Table 3.2 and Figure 3.1.
1 Identify the two continents whose population growth rates differ the most.
2 Why do you think that Africa experiences the shortest doubling time in the 
world? 
3 Briefly discuss the consequences of any rapid population growth you have 
observed in your locality. What measures do you suggest to correct the 
situation? 
4 Why is the beginning of the 20th century taken as a turning point in the history 
of world population? (Refer to Table 3.1 and Figure 3.1.) 
As it is shown in Table 3.2, Europe and Africa have shown very contrasting 
doubling times. The doubling times of the former and the later are 304 years and 
27 years, respectively. This implied that even among the developing regions, 
Africa has the fastest population growth rate in the world. 
Generally, nations are considered to be less developed if they have a lower 
standard of living than the developed nations. A large share of the population in 
these less developing countries live at subsistence levels, and medical resources

are limited. However, population growth in less developed nations occurs at a 
much faster rate than in the developed nations. 
As of 2000, 1.2 billion people lived in the developed nations of the world, and 4.9 
billion people lived in the less developed countries. By region, over half the world’s 
population was in East and South Asia: China, with 1.3 billion inhabitants, India 
with 1.1 billion, and Indonesia with 0.23 billion were the dominant contributors. 
Europe and the countries of the former USSR contained 14% of the world 
population, North and South America made up 14%, Africa had 13%, Asia 58% 
and the Pacific islands had about 1% (see Figure 3.3 and Table 3.4).

increase to 20.3% by 2050. Whereas, the population of Europe has shown a trend 
of decline by 12.7% in the same period. 
Activity 3.3
Work out the following questions in your group. 
1 Look at Figure 3.3. Describe the differences in population growth and projected 
growth, between 1950 and 2050, in the developed and developing countries. 
2 Based on Figure 3.3 and Table 3.3, identify the three most populous countries 
of each continent. 
3 Draw a map of the world, identifying these countries on it. 
3.2 COMPONENTS OF POPULATION CHANGE 
At the end of this section, you will be able to: 
Þ Describe components of population change; 
Þ Compute natural increase rate of the population. 
Key Terms 
³ fertility
³ mortality
³ emigration
³ infant mortality rate
³ cohort 
³ migration
³ immigration 
³ population change 
³ total fertility rate
What are the components of population change? How do the components 
affect population structure and population size? 
A change in the overall size of a population is the result of the collective effects of 
changes in fertility, mortality and migration. The three factors are collectively 
known as population-change dynamics or determinants or components. Fertility 
and mortality are biological factors, while migration is purely non-biological. 
The combined effect of the three factors controls the changes in population size 
and composition. Their influence is shown in Figure 3.4.
Grade 10 Geography 130
3.2 COMPONENTS OF POPULATION CHANGE 
What do the plus and minus signs imply in the above figure? 
As you can see from Figure 3.4, the population size of a particular area is the 
result of collective effects of birth, death and migration (here, “migration” is the 
net balance of immigration and emigration). Immigration and birth are positive 
factors, which tend to increase population size, while emigration and death are 
negative factors that reduce population size. 
Fertility 
What is fertility? What factors affect the fertility of a society? How can the 
fertility of a society be measured? 
The study of human fertility occupies a central position in the study of population 
because it is responsible for biological replacement and maintenance of the 
population of the human race. The growth of world population depends largely 
on human fertility. This is so because any society replenishes itself through the 
process of human fertility. Thus, in population dynamics, fertility is a force of 
expansion of population by counteracting the force of attrition caused by mortality. 
Fertility is the actual occurrence of live births in a given population; it is 
the beginning of life. Specifically, fertility refers to the actual reproductive 
performance of a population.

3.2 COMPONENTS OF POPULATION CHANGE 3.2 COMPONENTS OF POPULATION CHANGE 
Measures of fertility. Fertility can be determined using different methods, but it 
is measured most commonly in terms of: 
Â Crude Birth Rate (CBR), 
Â General Fertility Rate (GFR) and 
Â Total Fertility Rate (TFR). 
a Crude Birth Rate (CBR): is the most common and simplest index of 
fertility. It is simply the number of live births observed in one year among 
one thousand people in a given region. It can be expressed as a number of 
live births per thousand people.
where B is the total number of live births during a 
year, P is mid-year total population and k is a constant, 
conventionally 1000. 
Example 
If the number of live births in a population of 70,686,000 was 270,300, 
the crude birth rate is: 
This measure is simple to compute, but it is crude because its denominator includes 
all persons, regardless of their contribution to fertility (birth). For example all 
unmarried persons, including children, are included. This is the weakness of the 
CBR as a measure of fertility. 
b General Fertility Rate (GFR): The easiest method of refining the weakness 
of CBR is by expressing live births, not in terms of total population, but 
as a percentage of the number of adults or, even better, of the number of 
women of reproductive age (typically defined as between the ages of 15 
and 49). GFR measures the number of live births in a year per thousand 
women of reproductive age. It is calculated: 
where B is the total number of live births during a year, 
P1
 is mid-year population of women between 15 and 49 
years age and k is a constant, conventionally 1000.

3.2 COMPONENTS OF POPULATION CHANGE 
Fertility rates differ greatly among continents, regions and countries. Generally, 
fertility rate is much higher in developing countries than in the developed regions. 
Let us consider the following example.
Example 
The estimated mid-year population of a given country in 2000 was 
50,000,000, of which women in their reproductive ages constituted onefifth. In the course of the year, there were 500,000 live births. Calculate 
the general fertility rate of this population. 
Given:
 Number of live births = 500,000
Number of women in their reproductive age was one-fifth of total 
population = (1/5) × 50,000,000 = 10,000,000
Then, GFR = (500,000/10,000,000) × 1000 = 50 per 1000. This shows that 
50 children were born for every 1000 women in their reproductive years. 
Activity 3.4
Calculate the following: 
1 The number of live births for place “A” was 8400, and its mid year population 
was 240,000, find CBR.
2 The number of deaths for place “B” was 170,300, and its mid year population 
was 10,296,000. Calculate CDR.
3 The estimated mid-year population of a given country in 2000 was 100,000,000, 
of which women in their reproductive ages constituted 25%. In the course of 
the year, there were 600,000 live births. Find the general fertility rate of the 
population. 
What problem of GFR have you noticed from the above example? Explain to 
the class. 
GFR’s drawback is that it does not account for differences in age groups. Each 
age group is not equally fertile. That is, the child-bearing rate is appreciably 
higher in the age group of 20-29 than in the 15-19 and 30-49 age groups. 
Unit 3: World Population 133
3.2 COMPONENTS OF POPULATION CHANGE 3.2 COMPONENTS OF POPULATION CHANGE 
c Total Fertility Rate (TFR):
What makes TFR different from the other measures of fertility? How do you 
calculate it?
TFR is the average number of children that would be born alive to a woman during 
her lifetime if she were to pass through all her child-bearing years. This happens 
if the group under question passed through its reproductive span of life with these 
birth rates in each year of age. It is generally known as an effective summary 
rate for describing the frequency of child bearing in a year. More importantly, 
TFR is useful when comparison is made, for it is standardized for age and is a 
single summary measure. It is helpful for comparing the fertility performance of 
different populations or social groups. 
TFR is the sum of the age-specific birth rates (5-year age groups between 15 
and 49) for female residents of a specific geographic area (example: country, 
kelil, zone, kefle-ketema, woreda kebele, etc.) during a specified time period 
(usually a calendar year) multiplied by 5. This rate estimates the number of 
children a hypothetical cohort (person of same age group) of 1000 females in 
the specified population would bear if they all went through their childbearing 
years experiencing the same age-specific birth rates for a specified time period. 
More importantly, TFR is useful when comparison is made, for it is standardized 
for age and is a single summary measure. It is helpful for comparing the fertility 
performance of different populations or social groups.

Focus
Remember that, although CBR, GFR and TFR are the most common 
measures of fertility in a community, they are not the only measures. 
Although the CBR is simple to compute, it is said to be crude because it 
considers persons of all ages indiscriminately. The GFR refines the CBR, 
but it has a weakness, in that it regards all females aged 15-49, regardless 
of differences in their potential birth performances. Note that a woman can 
bear a child only after the onset of menstruation and can continue to bear 
children only until she reaches the age of menopause. Statistically, 15 is 
the age when menstruation begins, and 45-49 is the age span during which 
menopause occurs. Therefore, on average, women are less likely to bear 
children before the age of 15 or after the age of 50.
The number of children born to women in developing countries is much larger 
than to women in the developed regions (see Figure 3.5 and Table 3.6). 
Figure 3.5 shows differences regarding birth rate in developing and developed 
countries. 
In developing countries, e.g., Ethiopia, 
birth rates are high because people 
want and need large families. Also, 
life expectancy is relatively short due, 
primarily, to poverty and its effects.
“
Developing Countries Developed Countries
In developed countries, e.g., Japan, birth 
rates are low, often because people do not 
want to have many children. They prefer 
small family sizes. Also, life expectancy 
is relatively long due, primarily, to 
comparative wealth and its effects.
Why a high birth rate? Why a low birth rate? 
“We need many children: 
F to help us work on the land 
and to carry wood and water. 
F to care for us when we are 
ill or old and can not work.”
“Family planning controls the size of 
our family. 
F We only wanted two 
children, and we are sure they 
will live long lives, free from 
disease. “ 
“Children might get a job in the 
city and send us money. “ 
“Having a big family increases my 
importance in the village.” 
“My religion forbids birth control. “
“We can afford to spend more 
money on our car, holidays and 
entertainment.” 
I wanted to return to my career 
and not stay at home.” 
“We have pensions for when we 
are old.”

Form a group of not more than five and discuss facts outlined in Figure 3.5 and 
present your answers to questions 1 - 3 to the class and undertake the fourth activity. 
1 What factors affect fertility in developed countries and in developing countries? 
2 Give four reasons for each statement.
i Many families in developing countries are large, with five or more 
children. 
ii Many families in developed countries are small, often with not more than 
two or three children.
3 How can birth rates be reduced in developing countries? 
4 Design a poster showing the need for family planning for a small village or a 
neighbourhood in Ethiopia (your locality). Assume that the community members 
can read and understand it. 
Factors of Fertility Distribution 
Various factors affect fertility distribution in the world including those presented 
in Table 3.5. 
Table 3.5: Factors of fertility and their effects 
 Factors Effects 
1 Age at marriage: the age 
at which a person marries 
influences the number of 
children one can have.
Early marriage: more children are born 
to girls who marry early, because they 
are exposed to sex for more of their 
reproductive ages (15-49). They are also 
exposed to related health problems. 
2 Status of women: important 
components of status include 
access to (or lack of) education, 
employment, family decision 
making, etc.
i Education: Education usually offers 
women access to information about 
how to limit family size, increase their 
marriage ages, use contraception, 
and so forth.
ii Employment: Employment usually 
motivates women to limit family size, 
partly because they have less time 
for performing child-care tasks. Also, 
employment generally increases 
access to information about how to 
limit family size. 
Unit 3: World Population 137
3.2 COMPONENTS OF POPULATION CHANGE 3.2 COMPONENTS OF POPULATION CHANGE 
 Factors Effects 
3 Socio-cultural factors: religion, 
ethnicity and family structure.
Religion: the teachings of some religions 
oppose the use of contraceptive methods. 
This encourages large family size. 
Ethnicity: some communities are more 
biased toward males over females.
Family structure: Some families need their 
children to contribute socioeconomically 
– for example, by working on family farms 
and by providing their parents with the 
status of having many children. 
4 Sex preference (the desire to 
have children of one sex over 
the other). 
When a family wants children of a particular 
sex (usually male), but produces children of 
the other sex, they are likely to keep having 
more children until they achieve their goals. 
Activity 3.7
Part I
Form a group of three to five and discuss fertility conditions in your area. Based on 
the factors listed in Table 3.5, assess the fertility situation in your specific community. 
Identify which factor most strongly influences the fertility situation of the community. 
List the factors, according to their decreasing importance. Cite specific households 
that are good examples for each factor. Add more effects for each factor. 
1 Do you think information on family planning is needed for a woman to be able 
to make an informed choices that affect her fertility situation? Why? 
2 Are there barriers to accessing information about family planning in your 
locality? If yes, what are they, and how can they be reduced?
Part II
In your geography workgroup, perform these activities: 
1 Compare and contrast the population demographics of developed and 
developing countries. Cite some countries from each group to support your 
opinions.
2 Discuss relationships between fertility and poverty. Support your opinions with 
examples from your locality. 
3 Work with your group to choose a representative to present the group’s 
opinions to the class.

rates are to be controlled. These include 
F Improved status of women, including their rights to decide between the 
use of birth control and having children. 
F Improved educational levels regarding family planning, particularly 
for women. Also improved access to family-planning supplies.
A lesser, but still important condition is reduction of poverty and its effects. It 
was previously believed that high birth rates were a result of poverty. However, 
in those parts of the world where the status of women has been raised, there have 
been declines in birth rates even though there have been no obvious reductions in 
poverty. In all regions of the world, fertility rates are decreasing. However, Africa 
still has the highest fertility rate in the world. 
Activity 3.8
Answer the following questions. 
1 Why does Africa have the largest fertility rates? Discuss in pairs.
2 Calculate the crude birth rates for the following two hypothetical regions, A and B: 
i The number of live births and mid-year population in region A were 
4,500 and 160,000, respectively.
ii For region B, the number of live births was 20,500, and mid-year 
population was 2,500,000.
3 Work out the general fertility rates (GFR) for two hypothetical regions, F and G. 
i In region F, the number of newborn children was 73,060 and the number 
of women aged 15 – 49 years was 826,000. 
ii In region G, the number of live births was 50,000, and the number of 
women aged 15 – 49 years was 950,000. 
Mortality 
What is mortality? What factors affect mortality? 
Mortality is the occurrence of death. Mortality rates, though decreasing 
worldwide, are higher in the developing countries than in the developed ones. 
This difference is caused by variations in standards of living, nutrition, medical 
services, personal hygiene and environmental sanitation.

3.2 COMPONENTS OF POPULATION CHANGE 3.2 COMPONENTS OF POPULATION CHANGE 
Mortality can be measured in a number of ways, including the use of crude death 
rate and infant mortality rate.
Measures of Mortality 
i Crude death rate (CDR): is the ratio of the total registered deaths of a 
specified year in a region to the total mid-year population, multiplied by 
1000. It is computed as follows:
where CDR is crude death rate, D stands for total 
observed deaths, P is total mid-year population, and k 
is a constant, 1000.
Example: 
In a hypothetical region, the total number of deaths observed in 
2006 was 60,000, and the total mid-year population was 12,000,000. 
Therefore, the resulting CDR was: 
This number indicates that the deaths of 5 persons were observed for each 1000 
people. 
What are some of the weaknesses of CDR? Describe them.
ii Infant mortality rate (IMR): is the number of deaths of infants under the 
age of one year, per 1000 live births, in a given year. 
Example: 
A total of 400,000 babies were born in a certain region in 2010. Of these 
newborns, 340,000 babies survived their first year of life. Calculate 
the IMR of this region. 
Deaths under age one: 400,000 - 340,000 = 60,000 babies 
Out of 1000 children born in the year 2010, about 150 infants died 
before celebrating their first year of life.

3.2 COMPONENTS OF POPULATION CHANGE 
Focus
Infant mortality rate is a good indicator of the level of development 
of any country. In countries with better living conditions, for example, 
countries in Europe, mortality is comparatively low. In contrast, the less 
developed countries (example, most African countries, including Ethiopia), 
infant mortality is quite high, due to malnutrition, various diseases and 
poor environmental sanitation. Life expectancy is the number of years a 
newborn is expected to live. It tends to increase with standard of living.

ii Which country has better standard of living? Why?
Migration 
Does migration influence population? 
Migration involves movement of people and thereby influences both the rate 
of growth and distribution of population just like the other two components of 
population change. (Formal definitions, types and causes of migration are given in 
section 3.4.3). The most common measures of migration that can affect population 
growth of an area include:
a Immigration Rate: it is the number of people arriving at a destination 
per 1000 people in a given year. 
b Emigration Rate: it is the number of departing people from an area 
of origin per 1000 people of the area of origin in a given year. 
Immigrant rate = Number of immigrants
Total population at destination
 × 1000
Emigration rate = Number of emigrants
Total population at origin
 × 1000
Unit 3: World Population 141
3.2 COMPONENTS OF POPULATION CHANGE 3.2 COMPONENTS OF POPULATION CHANGE 
c Net Migration Rate (NMR): shows the net effect (balance) of 
immigration and emigration in an area. It can be expressed as an 
increase or decrease per 1000 people in the area in a given year. 
 
Example
Suppose the number of emigrants and immigrants of country ‘A’ are 40,000 
and 250,000 respectively. If the total population is 105 million, what is the 
NMR for country ‘A’?
 
Measures of Population Change
In order to calculate the change in the total population size of a particular nation 
or place one has to use the following formula (see Figure 3.4). 
i Rate of Natural Increase (RNI): it is the difference between birth 
and death rates. 
Hence, it is a naturally caused numerical change of a population 
which results from the interplay between fertility and mortality. It is 
expressed as: 
 RNI = BR – DR
Example 
If the birth rate and death rate of a certain country were 50 per thousand and 
28 per thousand, respectively, what was the rate of natural increase (RNI)? 
 = 2.2%
That is, 22 per thousand population or 2.2 per hundred people. 
ii Population Growth Rate (PGR): in order to find the growth rate of 
a population, we consider net migration rate and rate of natural 
increase.
 PGR = BR – DR ± NMR = RNI ± NMR 
Example 
If the RNI of place ‘y’ is 2.2% and the NMR is 2/1000, find the population 
growth rate for place ‘y’.
Net i M gration Rate = Number of Immigrants − Number of Emigrants
Total Population × 1000

census, reflecting a complete population count. A population pyramid, also 
called age structure diagram, is a graphical illustration. It normally forms the 
shape of a pyramid and shows the distribution of various age groups of each sex 
in a human population. 
It typically consists of two back-to-back bar graphs, with the population plotted 
on the x-axis and age on the y-axis, one showing the number of males and the 
other showing females in a particular population of five-year age groups (also 
called cohorts). Males are conventionally shown on the left and females on the 
right, and they may be measured in raw numbers or as percentage of the total 
population (See Figure 3.6).
Population pyramids are often considered to be the most effective way to 
graphically depict the age and sex distribution of a population. This is partly 
because of the very clear image that these pyramids present. 
Population is divided into age groups of five-year intervals (0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 
etc.) for each sex. The population of a given country can be further grouped into 
three categories (segments) of the population consisting of young dependents 
(0-14), elderly dependents (65+) and the working age groups that are economically 
active (15-65 years of age). The grouping applies to both males and females of all 
ages (See Figure 3.6.). 
A great deal of information about a population, broken down by age and sex, can 
be read from a population pyramid. For example, it can shed light on the extent 
of development and other aspects of the population. 
The proportion of the three age groups varies from region to region and among 
countries. Most developing countries have a large proportion of their population

in the young age group. But in developed countries, people in the adult and old 
age group account for the largest proportions of the population. As a result, the 
shape of the population pyramids of the two groups of countries is not the same 
(see Figure 3.6).
Observing different characteristics of a population pyramid can tell you a lot 
about the population it presents. 
F Width of the base of the pyramid: birth rate varies with the width 
of the base. A wide base indicates a high birth rate, and a narrow 
base indicates a low birth rate. The former is typical of populations of 
developing countries.
F Symmetry: statistically speaking, pyramids are relatively 
symmetrical. Any asymmetry indicates a size difference between males 
and females.
F Shape of sides: concave sides indicate a high death rate, and convex 
sides indicate a low death rate. The population pyramid of Ethiopia 
exhibits concave sides, indicating a high death rate.

Sex Structure or Composition 
What is sex structure? Which sex is dominant in your locality? Why? 
A population pyramid also tells how many people of each sex live in an area. This 
statistic is typically defined in terms of what is called sex-ratio (SR), which is a 
numerical measurement. It is the number of males per 100 females, or otherwise- for 
example, the number of females per 100 males. Sex ratio is expressed in percentage 
or ratio form. 
Where SR is sex ratio which may also be referred to as 
masculinity ratio Pm stands for the total number of males, 
and Pf
 stands for total number of females.
This is also possible and gives the number of females per 
100 males. This can be called femininity ratio as well as 
sex ratio.
Example: 
Say total students of a given school was 5000. Out of this 3000 were 
females. What was sex-ratio of student population? 
Solution: 
Dependency Ratio
What is dependency ratio? Is the dependency ratio of your locality or region 
high or low? Why? 
Why do we need to know about dependency ratio? 
The working age of people varies. Traditionally people worked until they were 
65 years old. The common trend now is for people to retire closer to 55 years 
of age. However, for statistical purposes, we recognize people between 15 and 
65 as the workers of a society. People under 15 and over 65 are considered 
dependent upon the working population. The age dependency ratio (ADR) of a 
population indicates how many people are dependent upon every 100 workers.

Focus
Age-sex structures of the population of different countries vary, depending 
upon variation in the socio-economic settings and demographic history of 
the individual countries. This is reflected in the shapes of their population 
pyramids. There are three classes of population: 
i Expansive or expanding population pyramids, which have the 
classic triangular shape with wide base and narrow top, indicating
a high birth rate and a high death rate.
ii The sides of stationary or stable population pyramids have a 
half-ellipse shape, which is a characteristic of a high standard 
of living due to low birth rate (due to good family planning), 
financial planning, education, etc. 
iii Contractive or contracting population pyramids have a narrower 
base than the reproductive age population. This indicates 
a decreasing population trend. The low birth rate is indicative of 
a well-developed country.

Why is the distribution of world population uneven? 
What factors have influenced the distribution of world population? 
The most important characteristic feature of current world-population distribution 
is its extreme unevenness. It was estimated, some years ago, that one-half of the 
world's people was contained within about 5% of the earth's land area while, in 
contrast, about 57% of the land area contained less than 5% of the population. 
World population distribution, and hence concentration, varies considerably 
across the earth, among different continents, between individual countries, 
between developed countries and developing countries, between rim lands 
and hinterlands, between highlands and lowlands, and between the Northern 
Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere (see Figure 3.7).
Unit 3: World Population 149
3.4 SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF WORLD POPULATION 3.4 SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF WORLD POPULATION 
3.4.1 Factors of Population Distribution
Numerous factors have positively and negatively influenced population 
distribution. The extreme current unevenness in population distribution is due to 
these factors: 
F Ecological (physical) factors
F Socio-economic factors
F Political factors
F Demographic factors
Some factors, for example, favourable climate, fertile soil, adequate water supply, 
and industrial development positively influence population concentration (See 
Figure 3.8a). Others, such as unfavourable climate (for example, extremely hot 
or cold and dry climates), mountainous regions of very rugged topography with 
poor soils, and inhospitable areas where communication and trade are difficult, 
discourage large human settlements (see Figure 3.8b). 
The four population clusters and the sparsely populated regions are found in 
varying geographical locations, have different population sizes and socioeconomic characteristics. Table 3.7 gives an overview of the various centers of 
high and low population concentrations, their locations and determining factors.

It was noted earlier that population distribution over the earth’s surface lacks uniformity. 
Some areas are overcrowded, while others are sparsely settled or uninhabited.

measurable in various ways. For example, we can relate numbers of inhabitants 
to area of lands inhabited: 
a Crude density or Arithmetic density 
b Agricultural density or Rural density
a Crude density or Arithmetic Density: is a measure of the number of 
inhabitants per unit area. This type of measurement is also known as

1 The population of Ethiopia was estimated at 79 million in 2010 (CSA 2010) and 
its total area is 1,106,000 km2
. Find the crude population density. 
2 The total population and total area of China in 1999, were 1, 264, 536,000 and 
9,596,960 km2 , respectively. Find the crude density. 
b Agricultural density or Rural density: It is the ratio of agricultural 
(rural) population to cultivated land. Agricultural density considers 
only agricultural population, the segment of an area’s population whose 
livelihood depends on agricultural activities. The area under consideration 
can be a single contiguous piece of land, or it can be multiple unjoined 
areas – such as the land occupied by all rural populations in all developing 
countries. In countries like Ethiopia, almost all rural areas are occupied by 
people who are engaged in agricultural activities and whose livelihoods 
depend mainly on agricultural income. This may not be the case in the 
developed regions. 
Activity 3.15
Part I
Perform the following activities:
1 Ethiopia has a total territorial expanse of about 1,106,000 km2
, out of which 
about 16% was under cultivation in 2007. Its urban population was about 
16.2% of the country’s total population which stood at about 73.9 million 
people. Rural population, was about 61.9 million, and the area under crop was 
about 176,960 km2
. Find agricultural density. 
2 Why is agricultural density a better measure of rural population density than 
the crude population density in countries like Ethiopia?
3 What advantages does agricultural density have for a country? 
4 What is the weakness of crude density in this respect?

5 What are the crude and agricultural population densities of each country? 
6 For which country does agricultural density appear to be a better measure than 
crude population density? Why? 
Agricultural population density is a more meaningful measure than crude 
population density for developing countries where agriculture is the dominant 
economic activity. It also gives a better indication of population pressure on 
natural resources. 
3.4.3 Human Migration
What is migration? Can we consider all kinds of people’s movements as 
“migration”? Why or why not? 
Definition and Types of Migration 
Many geographers consider migration to be the permanent or quasi-permanent 
relocation, for a substantial duration of an individual or group of individuals 
from a place of origin to a place of destination. Migration begins in an area 
of origin and is completed at an area of destination and might involve a stay 
of a substantial period one year or more. In order to avoid ambiguity, the term 
permanent migration is used for situations in which the mover has no intention 
of returning to the place of origin. 
When migrants cross an international frontier, they are referred to as either 
emigrants, if they are leaving a country or immigrants, if they are entering. 
Migrants who move within a country are referred to as out-migrants or inmigrants depending on whether they are leaving or entering a region. 
When migrants cross an international boundary, the movement is called 
international migration (see Figure 3.9). However, if the movement is within 
a national territory, it is referred to as internal migration. A movement in which 
Unit 3: World Population 155
3.4 SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF WORLD POPULATION 3.4 SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF WORLD POPULATION 
a migrant arrives at the last destination after a series of short-term moves to 
other locations is referred to as step migration. When people move out with the 
intention of returning back to their place of origin after a few months or a season 
or more, this movement is called seasonal migration. Seasonal migration takes 
place commonly in rural Ethiopia during peak and slack seasons of agricultural 
labour. 
Migration can take the form of refugee migration, when people move for political 
reasons, war, ethnic conflicts and discrimination or religious persecution; or 
evacuee migration, if movement is caused by natural calamities like earthquake, 
volcanic eruption, flooding, drought, etc.; or resettlement migration, when
people are displaced by war, natural calamity, etc. and are moved by government 
to a new location and, generally, given assistance in order to establish themselves 
therein. 
Activity 3.16
In your geography workgroup, discuss the following questions.
1 Which forms of migration are common in your community? Is anyone a migrant 
among your family members? Were all your household members, including 
Dad and Mama, born and raised in your area? 
2 What is the difference between ‘refugee’ and ‘evacuee’? 
3 What do you call the people whom the present government moved, some 
years back, from densely populated areas to sparsely populated parts of the 
country and settled them there?

3.4 SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF WORLD POPULATION 
Causes of Human Migration 
Many factors affect migration. These include economic, social and ecological 
considerations, which, in turn, are affected by individual perceptions and 
behaviour. These factors act in such a way as to ‘push’ or ‘pull’ migrants (see 
Figure 3.10). Pull factors are those which attract the migrant to a particular 
destination. For example, good social and welfare services, a pleasant environment 
and political stability are typical pull forces.
Push factors, on the other hand, are forces which work in the migrant’s home area. 
They impose pressures which persuade or compel a person to move away. For 
example, push factors include the impacts of natural disasters (drought, flood, and 
famine), low wages, poor employment and political instability. 
Â Economic factors: are often regarded as the main motivation for migration, 
acting as pull or push factors. The principal economic force is the search for 
employment, accompanied by the exploitation of natural resources, such as 
minerals, and the availability of good communication networks. 
Â Social factors: that influence migration, negatively and positively, include 
social oppression, political control and the availability of housing, health 
care and training.
Â Ecological factors: Environmental crises such as droughts, desertification 
and industrial accidents can have profound impacts on human migration. 
Environmental or ecological refugees have become the single largest class 
of displaced people in the world.

1 Classify the factors noted in Figure 3.10 as ecological, economic, socio-cultural 
and political factors. 
2 By asking ordinary people and government office holders in your community, 
identify economic, social and ecological reasons that make people migrate. 
3 What are some of the possible consequences of migration, both in areas of 
origin and destination? 
3.4.4 Urbanization
 What is urbanization? What factors affect the process of urbanization? 
What is Urban and What are Urban Settlements? 
The term urban is something (for example a settlement) relating to, belonging to, 
characteristic of, constituting, or forming part of a town or city. It is the opposite 
of rural. Urbanism on the other hand refers to a city or town characteristic, the 
typical condition of a city or town, or a way of life characteristic of a city or town.
Urbanization, in conventional terms, refers to the process through which society 
is transformed from being predominantly rural, in economy, culture and life style, 
to being predominantly urban. It is also a process of territorial reorganization, in 
that it shifts the locations, as well as the characteristics, of a population and its 
production activities. Typically, urbanization is commonly defined as the process 
by which large numbers of people become permanently concentrated in relatively 
small areas, forming cities or towns. 
Some of the criteria used to identify urban settlements and desiginate them as 
towns or cities include the status of an urban settlement, population size and of 
population function. 
In terms of population size, the minimum population of a locality considered 
as a city varies from 1000 or less (example: Canada) to 50,000 (Japan). In most 
countries, this threshold varies from 2000 to 5000. In Ethiopia, a settlement is 
designated as urban if the number of inhabitants equals or exceeds 2000, and 
if most of them are engaged in non-agricultural activities. Another defining 
characteristic is that the area is an officially municipality.
Grade 10 Geography 158
3.4 SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF WORLD POPULATION 
The course of human history has been marked by accelerating urbanization. In 
1800, less than 3% of the world’s population lived in cities. During the post 
industrial revolution, sometimes defined as 1900, about 20% lived in cities. By 
1950, 30% lived in cities. By the end of 1999, 47% lived in cities. Currently 
(2010) the percent of the world’s population in cities equals or exceeds that in 
rural areas (see Table 3.9.)

In your geography workgroup, perform these activities: 
1 Compare the level of urbanization at the continental level and identify the most 
and the least urbanized continents. 
2 Why do the more developed regions of the world have higher percentages of 
urban populations than the less developed regions? 
3 Why do the proportions of urban populations in the developing regions show 
faster growth rates than in the more developed regions? 
4 About three-fourths of the population of the developed countries live in urban 
centres. How do people in these regions earn their living? 
Work with your group to choose a representative to present the group’s 
opinions to the class.

Factors that affect Urbanization 
In your previous discussions, you might have considered, directly or indirectly, 
some of the factors that affect urbanization. Can you mention some of them to 
your class? 
One can attribute the growth and development of urbanization to several factors, 
including: 
F High rate of natural increase of population: This is happened when 
birth rates remain high, but death rates fall rapidly due to great 
improvements in social facilities and in food production, that resulted 
in population growth and so does urbanization 
F Significant of rural to urban migration: Many large cities in developing 
countries are growing at a faster rate due to rural ‘push’ factors that 
forced the people to leave the country side, and due to urban ‘pull’ 
factors where people migrate to cities hoping (in reality doesn’t exist) 
for better job prospects better social services, etc. 
F Industrialization: In the 19thC, industrialization led to a huge demand 
for labour in mining and manufacturing centers, in what are now 
referred to as developed countries. In these countries, urbanization was 
the result of economic development triggered by industrialization.
Activity 3.19
In your geography work group, answer the following questions and perform the 
following activities. 
1 Which factors have positively contributed to the growth of urbanization in 
Ethiopia? 
2 By referring to a world atlas or other sources, identify the ten largest cities of 
the world. Create a world map that emphasizes these big cities. 
3 What are the five largest urban centres (cities/towns) in Ethiopia?
4 What are the main problems of rapid urbanization in less developed countries 
like Ethiopia? Suggest possible ways of solving the problems.

3.5.1 Population Size, Distribution and 
Growth Rate
When did the population of Ethiopia started growing very fast? 
The population of Ethiopia was about 12 million toward the beginning of the 20th
century (1900). It had an annual growth rate of 0.2%. Had this growth continued, 
the population would have doubled in 346 years. The rate of growth of the 
population was relatively very slow until 1920. But, after 1920, the population of 
Ethiopia started growing very fast, and it took only 60 years to double. The 1950’s 
was another remarkable period. By 1960 the growth rate quadrupled, doubling 
the size of the population to 23.5 million. Then, between 1960 and 1990, i.e., 
within thirty years, the population once again doubled. During that period, its 
growth rate tripled, compared with the rate of 1920. The smallest doubling period 
recorded was in 1996, after which it started increasing again. 
Ethiopia conducted its first census in May 1984. So far, the governments have 
conducted three successive population and housing censuses. The first census 
report showed that the population of Ethiopia (together with Eritrea) was 42.2 
million. When we compare the 2007 census results with those of 1984 and 1994, 
we see that the population of the country increased by more than 31 and 21 
million over 23 and 13 years, respectively. The population growth rate increased 
from 2.9% in 1984-1985 to 3.0% in 1994-1995.

Since 1999, the growth rate has decreased at an average rate of about 0.2% per 
year (see Table 3.10). By 2010, the rate had dropped to about 2.6% per year. With 
the current growth rate of 2.6%, the country’s population is projected to grow by 
1.9 million annually, and to attain a size of about 79 million by 2010, 94.5 million 
in 2015, about 118 million by 2025. This trend would make Ethiopia the most 
populous country in Africa, next to Nigeria. This rapid growth seriously strains 
socio-economic development.

growth? Do you expect to contribute to the problem or to the solution? How?
Spatial Distribution of Population 
What does spatial (areal) distribution of population mean? Which parts of 
Ethiopia are densely and sparsely populated? Why? 
Spatial distribution of population is the pattern created as a result of human 
occupation of land surface for settlement. The pattern of Ethiopian population 
distribution is markedly uneven. For example, we have very high population 
densities in the highlands. On the other hand, the peripheral lowlands of the 
country, which account for more than 50% of the total area of the country, are 
Unit 3: World Population 163
3.5 POPULATION OF ETHIOPIA 3.5 POPULATION OF ETHIOPIA 
very sparsely populated. There are variations in the distribution at the national 
level as well as at lower levels for example, between and within regions, 
zones, weredas and kebele administration units. Table 3.11 shows the country’s 
population distribution at the regional level.

What have you observed from Table 3.11? Which regions were the most and 
least populous in the country in 2007? What factors are responsible for this 
variation? Which regions showed decrease or increase in their population 
proportion as compared to others, and why? 
More than 80% of the population lived in three regions – Oromiya, Amhara and 
Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR). Their populations 
accounted for 36.7%, 23.3% and 20.4% of Ethiopia’s total population, respectively. 
According to the 1984 Ethiopian census, the nation’s crude population density 
was 34 persons per square kilometer. By 1994, 10 years later, it had increased 
to 48.3. By 2007, the crude population density was almost double that of 1984 – 
about 67 persons per square kilometer.

Table 3.12 presents Ethiopia’s ten most densely and sparsely populated zones, 
as of 2009. Population densities exceeded 150 persons per square kilometre. All 
of the zones listed in the first half of the table, except for the last four shown in 
the table, are in the SNNPR and are enset-growing areas. Of the SNNPR zones, 
the most densely populated are Gedeo Kembata and Tembaro, and Sidama. Their 
densities exceed 400 persons per square kilometre. In contrast, there are places 
with very low population densities, below 25 persons per square kilometre. 
Almost all very low-population areas are found in the peripheral lowlands of 
Benishangul Gumuz, Gambella, Afar and Somali regions. Some of zones of very 
low-population densities include Agnewak, Metekel, Kemashi, Zone one (Afar),

The spatial distribution of Ethiopia’s population is uneven, characterized 
by high population density on the highlands while lowlands have very 
low population density. Such uneven distribution of population has 
been the result of ecological (physical) factors and human factors (see 
Figure 3.13). More important physical factors include climate (mainly rainfall and 
temperature), soil, vegetation and relief (altitude). The human factors primarily 
consist of historical factors, for example peopling of the country and migration, 
development of infrastructure, types of economic activities and political factors 
related to government policies such as resettlement programs, land tenure 
system, villagization process, etc. All these factors individually or collectively 
have influenced human settlements favorably or adversely. They have either 
encouraged or discouraged settlement. 
Activity 3.21
In your geography workgroup, perform these tasks. 
1 Find a political map of Ethiopia that shows the nation’s administrative units. 
Locate the ten most densely populated and most sparsely populated areas of 
the country. (See Table 3.12 again.)
2 Which ecological and human factors, for example, those shown in Figure 3.13, 
could have influenced the patterns of population distribution, you considered 
in Table 3.13? 
3 Variation of physical factors such as climate (temperature and rainfall), soil, and 
vegetation, are strongly correlated with altitude. With this fact in mind, explain 
the impacts of changes in elevation on population distribution.

3.5.2 Components of Population Change in 
Ethiopia 
What factors affect fertility, mortality and migration? How does the three 
components of population change influenced growth rate of the population of 
Ethiopia? 
Fertility in Ethiopia 
Is the rate of birth higher or lower in Ethiopia, compared to the rest of Africa 
and to the world at large? 
What are the trends of fertility in Ethiopia? Is fertility decreasing or increasing? 
Why? What measures, if any, have been taken to improve the situation in your 
locality? If none have been taken, why is that? 
Ethiopia’s total fertility rate is one of the highest in the world. In 1984, TFR was 
7.52 per woman. By 1994 it dropped to 6.74 (see Table 3.14), and then to 5.4 in 
2010.
There is significant fertility variation between urban and rural areas. For example, 
in 1984, TFR in urban areas was 6.33, while it was 8.08 in rural areas. In 2010 
these rates, respectively, dropped to 4.5 and 7.19. 
Fertility also varies from region to region. In 1994, Oromiya and the SNNPR 
recorded the highest TFRs, reaching as high as 7.26 and 7.16, respectively. In 
contrast to this, Addis Ababa, Dire Dawa, Harari and Gambella recorded TFRs 
of less than 4.3.

Activity 3.22
In your geography workgroup, study Table 3.14 and answer the following questions.
1 Which regions have the highest CBR in their rural and urban areas? Why? 
2 Why do rural areas have higher TFRs than urban areas? What do you suggest to 
improve the situation?
3 Why is that both CBR and TFR are lower in urban areas than in rural areas?
4 Why are crude birth rates as well as TFR generally higher in Ethiopia than in 
most of the rest of the world?
5 Choose 10 families (households), including yours, in your locality and answer 
the following question: 
i How many children does each family have? 
ii Do parents in your community tend to have many or few children? Why? 
iii Do women in your locality have easy access to medical, education and 
family planning services? If no, why not? What is the effect of such 
availability or lack of availability?

Mortality in Ethiopia 
Has the number of deaths in your community per year increased or decreased 
during your lifetime? Your parents’ lifetimes? What causes death most often in 
your locality? Among which age groups is death observed most frequently in 
your community?
Mortality is the measure of frequency of deaths in a population. Ethiopia has one 
of the highest levels of mortality in the world (see Table 3.15). The main causes 
of such high mortality are the effects of poverty, low living standards and poor 
access to health services.
Other significant factors include civil war, and recurrent drought and famine. 
Deaths of children under the age five accounts for over half of all deaths in the 
country. The main causes of children death are measles, malaria, malnutrition, 
and acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia and influenza. 
However, despite all of the current factors that cause deaths in Ethiopia, 
mortality rates have decreased because of improved medical technology and the 
population’s improved access to health services. During the last two decades, 
crude death rate dropped from 20 per 1000 population in 1970 to 16.4 per 1000 in 
1990 and then to 12 per 1000 in 2010. Similarly, the infant mortality rate declined 
from 153 deaths per 1000 live births in 1970 to 110 in 1990 and then to 77 in 
2010 (see Table 3.15 again). 
Unfortunately, however, many people now fear that such decreasing trend (and 
that of increasing life expectancy) will soon be reversed due to the increasing 
prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia’s population. For 1999, estimates put the 
number of infected people in the country at 3 million. Now, ten years later, some 
experts are predicting increases in mortality rates and decreases in life expectancy.

3.5.3 Population Structure of Ethiopia 
Can you remember the factors that influence population structure? How 
does population structure influence the process of Ethiopia’s socio-economic 
development? 
Age Structure 
Which age group is greatest in Ethiopia? What are the socio-economic and 
demographic implications of its size? Does the shape of Ethiopia’s population 
pyramid correspond to that of most developing countries?

Table 3.16 presents Ethiopia’s population age distribution. As you can see from the 
recent population pyramid of Ethiopia shown in Figure 3.6a and from the data in 
Table 3.16, Ethiopia’s population is predominantly young. It has persistently 
remained so, at least since 1970. On average, about 45% of the population is 
young and economically dependent. Elderly people account for about 3% of the 
total. This would mean only 52% of the population is economically active and 
supports both itself and the rest of the population. Ethiopia has one of the largest 
non-productive populations in the world. This is a direct result of the country’s 
high fertility rate.

With such a large dependent young population, government expenditure for 
education, health, shelter, food and other basic social services is very high. The 
only way that Ethiopia can release this large amount of budgetary resources for 
more economically productive investments is by reducing its dependency ratio.
Focus
Fast population growth, like that of Ethiopia and many other developing 
countries, produces a youthful population dominated by children who are 
economically dependent. This age-structure has the potential to increase the 
momentum of population growth as those numerous children grow up and 
enter their reproductive years and have multiple children of their own. This 
demographic instability of large, highly dependent and consuming, rather than 
effectively producing, populations cripples the socio-economic development 
process and can impede sectorial planning. Moreover, unemployment and 
under employment tend to prevail due to national economic issues.

Sex Structure 
What is the importance of studying sex structure? 
Sex is one of the basic demographic characteristics of a population. Sex structure 
is very important for demographic analysis because it provides useful information 
about reproductive potential, human resources, and so on.

What does Table 3.17 show you? For example, which sex is most numerous at 
national and regional levels? 
In 2007, Ethiopia had an almost balanced (one-to-one) sex ratio, both in rural and 
urban areas. The sex ratio for the whole country was 100.8. This meant that in 
the 2007 estimate, males slightly outnumbered females. Earlier, 1999, estimates 
indicated slightly different sex ratios. In rural areas, males slightly outnumbered 
females – the sex ratio was 101.2. In urban areas, females slightly outnumbered 
males – the sex ratio was 98.5.
Unit 3: World Population 173
3.5 POPULATION OF ETHIOPIA 3.5 POPULATION OF ETHIOPIA 
Regional sex-ratio data generally supported the preceding data for the nation as a 
whole, showing slight variations. 
Male populations exceeded female populations in all regions except in Addis 
Ababa, Tigray and the SNNPR. In Addis Ababa, whose population is nearly 
100% urban and may be considered ‘representative’ of other urban centres of the 
country, the number of females is considerably higher than the number of males.

5 Calculate the sex-ratio for each grade or grades (10-12) in your school? Which 
grade has the highest sex-ratio? What does the ratio indicate? 
3.5.4 Population Policy of Ethiopia 
What is population policy? Why has the government of Ethiopia formulated a 
population policy? When did it do that? What type of population policy has been 
adopted in Ethiopia? Do you support the idea of this type of policy? Why or why not? 
Population policy is defined in a variety of ways. Some of them include: 
F “All deliberate government actions intended to influence population 
growth, size, distribution and composition”;
Grade 10 Geography 174
3.5 POPULATION OF ETHIOPIA 
F “A deliberate effort by a national government to influence the three 
demographic variables: fertility, mortality and migration.” 
F “Measures initiated by governments to influence, in a targeted direction, 
the size, rate of change, composition or geographic distribution of a 
population.” 
What did you understand from the three above definitions of population policy? 
What is the main issue stressed by all of the definitions? 
Generally, population policies are used as guidelines to create positive relationships 
between population and resources. To this end, they are used to ensure balanced 
growths of population and economy. Maintaining a balance between a country’s 
population and its economy helps improve the peoples’ quality of life while 
improving the environment. 
There are two major types of population policy used by different countries in the 
world: 
a Pro-natalist (populationist) policies: they are designed to encourage 
population growth. Such policies are adopted with the objective 
of achieving various goals such as maintaining military strength, 
economic production and national pride. When more-developed 
countries have expanding economies but very low growth rates, 
they adopt pro-natalist population policy programs. Examples: the 
Netherlands, Kuwait and Israel. 
b Anti-natalist policies: they are designed to reduce birthrates. Such 
policies are promoted for several reasons. For example, moderating 
rapid population growth and preventing related social problems such 
as shortages of housing, education and services. Example; China. 
As you know, Ethiopia has a rapid population growth rate and one of the fastest 
growing populations in the world. Because of this, the government adopted an 
anti-natalist population policy since 1993. As such the population policy of the 
country aims at attaining these general objectives: 
a Closing the gap between high population growth and low economic 
productivity through planned reduction of population growth and 
increasing economic returns; 
b Speeding up economic and social development processes through 
holistic, integrated development programs designed to speed up the 
structural differentiation of the economy and employment; 
Unit 3: World Population 175
3.5 POPULATION OF ETHIOPIA 3.5 POPULATION OF ETHIOPIA 
c Reducing the rate of rural-to-urban migration; 
d Maintaining and improving the carrying capacity of the environment 
by taking appropriate environmental-protection and conservation 
measures; 
e Raising the economic and social status of women by freeing them 
from the restrictions and hard work of traditional life and making it 
possible for them to participate productively in the larger community; 
f Significantly improving the social and economic status of unprotected 
or easily affected groups; 
g Facilitating research programs in reproductive health; 
h Developing population programs specially designed to promote male 
involvement in family planning; 
i Diversifying methods of contraception with particular attention to 
increasing the availability of male-orientated methods. 
Activity 3.25
In your geography workgroup, answer the following questions and perform the 
following activities. 
1 Of the two main types of population policy, which one is more appropriate for 
the demographic characteristics of the population of Ethiopia? Why? 
2 Explain briefly how anti-natalist population policies can contribute to the well 
being of the environment in your locality. 
3 How can the traditional institutions like “Edir”, “Equb”, “Mahaber” and others 
contribute to implementing population policies in your locality? Identify the 
obstacles that have hindered these institutions from acting as facilitators for 
such changes. Suggest possible strategies to overcome the obstacles.

 UNIT SUMMARY 
Þ Until 1650, the world’s population grew quite slowly. But by 2000 A.D, it had 
reached six billion. The current annual world growth rate is quite largeabout 1.5%. But developing countries have higher growth rates, and these 
rates are much higher than those of the developed countries. 
Þ For instance, Africa and Europe has shown a very contrasting population 
growth trends. The former has shown fastest growth rate with shortest 
doubling time but the later has revealed an opposite trends. 
Þ By 2010, world population has reached 6.9 billion. The first three populous 
continents may include Asia, Africa and Europe, and then followed by 
L. America, N. America and Oceania according to their size of population.
Þ The three leading populous countries in Asia (China, India and Indonesia), 
in Europe (Geromany, UK and Italy), in North America (USA,Mexioc and 
Canada), in Latin America (Brazil, Argentina and Colombia) and in Africa 
(Nigeria, Egypt and Ethiopia). 
Þ The population of any area is determined by fertility, mortality and 
migration. The difference between birth and death rates is known as rate 
of natural increase. Overall, growth rate is determined by the net effect of 
natural increase and net migration rate. The three main age groups that 
determine population structure are young, adult and old age. 
Þ Population pyramids show considerable differences in population age 
structures between developed and developing countries. In the former, it 
is rectangualr at the middle adn narrow both at the base and at the top. 
But in the later, it is narrow at the top and very broad at the base. 
Þ Population is unevenly distributed across the earth’s surface. This distribution 
is dictated by positive and negative factors. Favourable climate, fertile soil, 
adequate water supply and industrial development positively influence 
population concentration. Where as unfavourable climate (extremely hot 
or cold and dry climates) mountaiinous regions of very rugged topography 
with poor soil, and inaccessible areas discourage large human settlements. 
Unit 3: World Population 177
Unit Review
Þ Urbanization is the increase in the proportion of people living in cities. It is 
most rapid in cities of developing countries, where it causes considerable 
problems. 
Þ Population denisty, which shows the spread of population over space, 
can be measured using crude (arithmetic) density and agriculatural (rural) 
density. The former is the best measure of population density in agrarian 
countires such as in Ethiopia. 
Þ The major causes of migration include economic factors (employment 
opportunities, communication and transport networks, etc), social factors 
(social facilities, political control, etc) and ecological factors (ecological 
crises such as droughts, desertification, etc). 
Þ There are many factors that affect urbanization like rate of natural increase, 
rural to urban migration, establishment of large number of industries, the 
development of commerce, transportation and communication, etc. 
N. America, L. America and Europe are the most urbanized continents 
followed by Asia and Africa accordingly.
Þ By 1900, the estimated population of Ethiopia was only 11.8 million. Since 
then, it has grown at a rapid rate. At the current rate, the country’s 
population is projected to grow by 1.9 million persons annually. Fertility and 
mortality are the main factors in population growth rates. Migration has 
very little effect because most of the population has low mobility across 
international boundaries. 
Þ The pattern of Ethiopiain population distribution is marked unequal. High 
population densities observed in the highlands but teh peripheral lowlands 
of the country are very sparsely populated. 
Þ Ethiopian population is predominatly young, which is economically 
dependent with elderly people upon the economically active population. 
This adversely affect the development of the country at large. 
Þ The population pyramid of Ethiopia is very wide at the base that indicates 
a high birth rate and very narrow towards the top due to a high infant 
mortality rate and relatively short life expectancy. The country also has 
almost a balanced sex ratios both in rural and ruban areas. 
Þ There are two main types of population policy: pro-natalist and antinatalist. Ethiopia’s population policy’s main goal is to achieve a balanced 
population growth rate. It was launched in 1993 and is essentially antinatalist.
