In Grade 10, you have studied about hydrocarbons and alcohols. In this unit, you will
study about another important class of organic compounds called carboxylic acids and
esters. These compounds are present in many fruits and flowers. Many carboxylic acids
are used as food additives in jams, jellies, candies and pickels, etc. You will also study
about fats and oils which are esters . Sodium or potassium salts of long chain fatty acids
are called soaps which play a major role as cleansing agents.

Nomenclature of Carboxylic Acids
i Common names carboxlic acids
a Straight chain monocarboxylic acids
A large number of carboxylic acids have widely used common names which need to be
learned. Those with an even number of carbon atoms ranging from 4 to 22 may be obtained
by hydrolysis of animal and vegetable fats and oils. They are referred to as fatty acids, and
they have common names derived from various sources. Formic acid derives its name
from the Latin word for ants, because it is one of the toxic ingredients of the secretion
injected by the stinging ant. Butanoic acid (butyric acid) derives its name from butter, in
which it is found when the butter becomes rancid. Caproic, caprylic, and capric acids are
involved in the odor of a goat, and their names derive from the Latin word, caper, for goat.
Table 6.1 lists common names of some of the most important monocarboxylic acids.

b Branched chain and substituted carboxylic acids
In common naming system, the branched chain and substituted acids are named as
derivatives of straight chain carboxylic acids. In this case, the position of the side chain or
substituents is indicated by Greek letters, α, β, γ, δ... for designating the 1st, 2nd, 3rd,…

name is butyric acid. In addition to this, two methyl groups are attached to
α-and β-positon carbon atoms in the structure. Now, the complete common
name is α, β-dimethylbutyric acid.

ii IUPAC names of carboxlic acids
a Straight chain monocarboxylic acid
According to IPUAC system, monocarboxylic acids are named as alkanoic acids. The
longest chain of carbon atoms containing the carboxyl group is selected and the name is
derived from the corresponding alkane by replacing the suffix ‘‘–e’’ with ‘‘–oic acid’’.
Example 6.6
1. Write the IPUAC names for:
a H–COOH b CH3
–COOH
Solution:
a The longest chain contains only one carbon atom. The corresponding alkane
name is methane. Now, we drop the suffix ‘‘–e’’ and replace it by ‘‘–oic acid’’
so, the complete IPUAC name becomes methanoic acid.
H–COOH Methanoic acid
b Similarly, the longest chain in the structure is derived form and alkane with two
carbon atoms called ethane. Now, when we drop the suffix ‘‘–e’’ and replace
it with ‘‘–oic’’ acid, we get the complete IPUAC name of ethanoic acid.

Solution:
a The carboxylic acid given contains three carbon atoms which makes IUPAC
name to be propanoic acid. There is also methyl group attached to the 2nd

name is 2-methylpropanoic acid.
 CH3
–CH(CH3

b The longest chain in the structure consists of four carbon atoms and this gives
IUPAC name of butanoic acid. The chloro group (–Cl) is attached to the 3rd
carbon atom and the methyl group is located at the 2nd carbon atom. Based
on the alphabetical order, these substituents are arranged as 3-chloro-2-
methyl. Finally, the complete IUPAC name of this acid becomes 3-chloro2-methyl butanoic acid.
 CH3
–CH(Cl)–CH(CH3

c Dicarboxylic acids
In IUPAC system, dicarboxylic acids are named as alkanedioic acids. These names are
obtained by replacing the suffix ‘‘–e’’ in the name of corresponding alkane by ‘‘–dioic
acid’’.
Example 6.8
1. Write the IUPAC name for:
HOOC–CH2
–CH2
–COOH
Solution:
This dicarboxylic acid contains four carbon atoms. The name of the corresponding
alkane is butane. Now, the suffix ‘‘–e’’ is replaced by ‘‘–dioic acid’’. This gives

6.1.2 Physical Properties of Carboxylic Acids
Activity 6.3
Form a group and discuss the following:
1. The solubility of monocarboxylic acids in water decreases with increase in molecular
mass.
2. The higher monocarboxylic acids are almost odourless.
3. Should the alcohols possess higher or lower boiling points than that of monocarboxylic
acids of comparable molar masses?
Share your ideas with the class.
1. State
The lower aliphatic acids containing up to 9 carbon atoms are liquids, whereas the higher
members are colourless waxy solids. Benzoic acid and most of its derivatives are also
colourless solids.
CARBOXYLIC ACIDS, ESTERS, FATS AND OILS
329
2. Odour
The odours of the lower aliphatic acids progress from sharp, irritating odour of methanoic
acid and ethanoic acids to the distinctly unpleasant odour of the butanoic, pentanoic and
hexanoic acids. The higher acids have little odour because of their low volatility.
3. Boiling Point
Carboxylic acids have higher boiling points than alcohols of the similar size. For example,
ethanoic acid (CH3
COOH) boils at 118°C while the alcohol of comparable molecular
mass, propan-1-ol (CH3
CH2
CH2
OH) boils at 97.2°C. The higher boiling points of the
carboxylic acids are also caused by hydrogen bonding between two molecules of acid to
produce a dimer. The –OH and C O groups of one acid molecule form hydrogen
bonding with C O and –OH groups of another molecule. Figure 6.1 shows the structure
of two carboxylic acids with two intermolecular H-bonds between them.

The formation of a dimer immedately doubles the size of the molecule and so increases the
Van der Waals dispersion forces between one of these dimers and its neighbours resulting
in a high boiling point.
4. Solubility
In the presence of water, the carboxylic acids do not dimerize. Instead, hydrogen bonds
are formed between water molecules and individual molecules of acid. Carboxylic acids
up to four carbon atoms mix well with water in any proportion. The solubility in water
decreases with the increasing molecular mass and higher acids are almost insoluble. The
carboxylic acids dissolve in water due to formation of hydrogen bonding with water

The carboxylic acids show reactions due to the alkyl or aryl group and the carboxyl group.
The carboxyl group is further considered to be made up of a carbonyl and a hydroxyl
group. All these groups modify the properties of each other due to their interaction. Some
of the common reactions of carboxylic acids are:

6.1.4 Preparation of Carboxylic Acids
One of the important methods for preparation of carboxylic acids is oxidation. Many
saturated monocarboxylic acids are obtained by the oxidation of the corresponding primary
alcohols whereas aromatic acids are obtained from the corresponding alkylbenzenes.
i) Oxidation of Primary Alcohols: The primary alcohols are readily oxidized to the
corresponding carboxylic acids by their reaction with common oxidizing agents like
potassium permanganate or potassium dichromate. The oxidation can also be carried
out by passing the vapours of primary alcohols through copper (II) oxide.

For example, oxidation of ethanol yields acetic acid (ethanoic acid).

ii) Oxidation of Alkylbenzenes: Aromatic compounds containing alkyl group as substituent
undergo oxidation to form aromatic acids. The reaction involves oxidation with potassium
permanaganate or potassium dichromate under vigorous conditions. The alkyl group
is oxidised to carboxyl group irrespective of its size. For example, toluene and
ethylbenzene, both give benzoic acid on refluxing with KMnO4
 in alkaline medium.

Large quantities of acetic acid is obtained in industry from fermentation of ethanol. The
process is known as Quick Vinegar Fermentation Process. In the process large wooden
vats (Figure 6.4) are used which have a perforated bottom. They are packed with wood
shavings moistened with old vinegar. Ethanol solution is poured from the top and trickles
down slowly to the perforated bottom. From the lower portion, air is pumped in the vat.
The bacteria present in old vinegar, ferment the ethanol into acetic acid. The liquor
obtained at the bottom is recirculated through the tower. The maximum concentration
of acetic acid obtained by this process is about 10%, which can be fractionated to yield
glacial acetic acid.

Activity 6.6
Form a group and discuss the following question. After the discussion, share your idea
with the rest of the class.
1. What are fatty acids and why are they named so?
2. Give some examples of fatty acids.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 11
338
Fatty acids are a carboxylic acids with a long hydrocarbon chains. Fatty acids are found in
all cells. The hydrocarbon chains of animal fatty acids are more saturated than those of
vegetable origin. With only a few exceptions, the fatty acids are all straight-chain compounds.
Most fatty acids contain an even number of carbon atoms.
Fatty acids that do not contain carbon-carbon double bonds are termed as saturated fatty
acids, and those that contain one or more double bonds are called unsaturated fatty acids.
When there is only one double bond, it is usually between the ninth and tenth carbon atoms

6.1.6 Uses of Carboxylic Acids
Acetic acid is used as a solvent and as a starting material in the preparation of acetates,
acetic anhydride, etc. It is also used to prepare the vinyl acetate polymer which is used in
paints and adhesives. Vinegar contains about 8-10 % acetic acid which is used in many
food items. Aspirin, the common painkiller, is prepared by the reaction of salicylic acid
(2-hydroxylbenzoic acid) with acetic acid.

Carboxylic acids are very important, industrially. Perhaps one of the most important industrial
applications of long chain carboxylic acid is for making soaps, detergents, and shampoos.
Carboxylic acids are also important in the manufacture of greases, crayons, and plastics.

6. 2 ESTERS
At the end of this section, you should be able to:
• list common sources of esters;
• write the general structural formula of esters;
• write the molecular formulas and names of some simple esters;
• describe the physical properties of esters;
• explain the chemical properties of esters;
• explain the general methods of preparation of esters; and
• describe some common uses of esters
6.2.1 Sources of Esters
Activity 6.7
Form a group and discuss the following:
Why do some fruits and flowers have pleasant odours?
Share your ideas with the rest of the class.
Esters are among the most widely occurring compounds in nature. Many esters are pleasantsmelling substances and are responsible for the flavor and fragrance of many fruits for
example, apples, pears, banana, pineapple, strawberry, etc. Oils, fats and waxes of plants
or animal origin are all esters. Many esters are found in flowers also and form the part of
essential oils obtained from flowers.
6.2.2 Structure and Nomenclature of Esters
Esters are derivatives of carboxylic acids in which the hydroxyl group of carboxylic acid
has been replaced by an alkoxy group. Esters can also be formed by the reaction between
acids and phenols. In such cases, the hydroxyl group is replaced by an alkoxy group.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 11
340
Esters can be represented by the general formula
where R = hydrogen, alkyl or an aryl group and R′ = alkyl or an aryl group.
Esters are named by the common system as well as by IUPAC system. In both the cases,
the name consists of two parts. The first part is named on the basis of the portion coming
from alcohol and the second part of the name is based on the portion from acid. Therefore,
it is necessary to identify first the portions coming from alcohol and carboxylic acid.
R – C – OH R – C – OH + H–O–R  R–C – O – R
O O
Acid portion Alcohol
portion
Carboxylic acid Alcohol
The above reaction shows that the portion coming from alcohol is attached to the oxygen
as alkyl group, and the acid portion is attached to the oxygen through carbonyl group.
While writing the name of an ester, first the name of alkyl group is written first followed by
the name of the acid by replacing -ic acid with -ate. When we use the common name of
carboxylic acid, the name of the ester is a common name, and when IUPAC name of the
acid is used, we get IUPAC name for ester. For illustration, consider the ester formed from
ethyl alcohol and methanoic acid.
H – C – O – CH H – C – O – CH2 – CH3
O
The common name for this ester is ethyl formate, and the IUPAC name is ethyl methanoate.
The formulae and names of some esters are listed in Table 6.7.

Activity 6.8
Form a group and discuss the following questions. After the discussion, share your ideas
with the rest of the class.
1. Do you expect esters to have lower or higher boiling points compared to carboxylic
acids of comparable molecular mass?
2. Do you expect esters to have lower or higher boiling points compared to alcohols of
comparable molecular mass?
i) Odour
In sharp contrast to the disagreeable odours of carboxylic acids, esters have pleasant
odour. The odour of many fruits and flowers result from mixtures of carboxylic esters, and
many of them are used in perfumes and food flavoring.
ii) Boiling points
The boiling points of esters increase with increasing molecular mass. Branched-chain esters
have lower boiling points than their straight-chain isomers. Esters have lower boiling points
than carboxylic acids and alcohols of comparable molecular mass. This is because ester
molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds with each other.
iii) Solubility
Esters of low molecular mass are fairly soluble in water. Since carboxylic esters can form
hydrogen bonding with water (Figure 6.5), it is not surprising that their solubility in water is
about the same as that of carboxylic acids of the same molecular mass. The solubility of
esters in water decreases with increasing molecular mass. All esters are soluble in organic
solvents.

with the rest of the class.
1. What would happen when esters are treated with water?
2. Recall the reactants that form esters. What was the by-product of the condensation
reaction?
i) Hydrolysis
One of the most important reactions of esters is their hydrolysis, which yields corresponding
carboxylic acids and alcohols. The hydrolysis reaction is speeded up in presence of a
mineral acid which act as catalyst in this reaction.
The general reaction for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of esters can be written as:
R–C–O–R R – C – O – R + H2O R–C–O–H + R O R – C – O – H + R – OH
O O

Esters also undergo base-catalyzed hydrolysis to give salts of carboxylic acids and alcohols.
Base-catalyzed ester hydrolysis is called saponification. Sodium hydroxide or potassium
hydroxide are the bases generally used for hydrolysis. For synthetic purpose, base catalysis
is often preferred, because the reaction is not reversible.

6.2.6 Uses
Esters have numerous uses as solvents, medicines, clothing (e.g. polysters), fragrances in
perfumes, and plasticizers (e.g. octyl phthalate).
Most esters of small acids and alcohols are non-corrosive, non-toxic liquids with good
properties for use as solvents. Esters are used as solvents for oils and fats, nail polishes,
varnishes, paints, gums and resins. Because of their pleasant fruity smells, esters are used
in making artificial flavours and perfumes. Table 6.8 depicts same common fruits and the
esters responsible for their flabours (see also Figure 6.6).

6.3.1 Source and Structure of Fats and Oils
Activity 6.10
Form a group and perform the following activity:
Collect samples of butter, lard, tallow, peanut oil, soyabean oil and olive oil. Classify them
according to vegetable or animal origin and according to their physical state. Do you find
any relation between their source and the physical state?
Share your ideas with the rest of the class.
Fats and oils belong to a class of biomolecules called lipids. They are triesters of
glycerol which are collectivity known as triglycerides or triacylglycerols.
The distinction between a fat and an oil depends on their physical states. If the
substance is solid or semisolid at ordinary temperature, it is termed as a fat and if it is
fluid, it is called an oil.
Fats and oils are widely found in nature especially in living things. Animal fats and oils
are derived both from terrestrial (land) and marine (water) animals. Marine fats
include liver oils, blubber oils, and fish oils.
Vegetable fats and oils are found in greatest abundance in fruits and seeds. While fats
and oils occur in the roots, stalks, branches and leaves of plants.
Structure of Fats and Oils
Fats and oils are triesters. Variation in the structure of fats and oils occur in the fatty
acid portion of the triglyceride (or triacylglycerol).

Activity 6.11
From a group and compare vegetable oils with mineral oils. Do they behave in similiar
fashion? Explain.
Share your ideas with the rest of the class.
The common physical properties of fats and oils are that; they are greasy to the touch, and
have lubricating properties; they are not readily volatile; and may be burned without leaving
any residue, that is, ash.
Fats like butter, lard and tallow are solids at room temperature. On the other hand, oils are
mainly obtained from plants, e.g., corn oil, peanut oil, cotton seed oil, olive oil and soyabean
oil which are liquids at room temperature. All oils and fats are colourless, odourless and

are soluble in organic solvents e.g. benzene, ether and chloroform etc.

Can you suggest a method of converting unsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids.

Oils can be converted to fats by addition of hydrogen (hydrogenation) at high pressure
in presence of nickel or palladium as catalyst. This process of converting oils to hard
fats is known as hardening of oils. This reaction is used in the preparation of margarine.

Form a group and perform the following activity:
Obtain two packets of fried potato chips from the market. Open one packet and smell it.
Now place half the contents in a close tight container and other half in an open container.
Let the second packet be kept as such. After 15 days, smell the chips kept in the open
container, closed container and sealed packet. Record your observations and find out what
is the best method to keep such items.
Share your findings with the class.
Fats and oils are quite reactive substances. When stored for any considerable length of
time, especially when the temperature is high and the air has free access to them, they
deteriorate and spoil. Among the various fats, spoilage takes the form of rancidity.
Fats and oils develop an unpleasant odour due to rancidity. It is caused mainly due to the
hydrolysis of ester linkage and oxidation across the double bonds. In this respect, different
fats differ markedly. Some spoil very much more rapidly than others. The fat acquires a
peculiarly disagreeable odor and flavor.
The rancidity of a given fat is not necessarily the result of long storage under unfavorable
conditions. The fat may have been spoiled and rancid from the moment of its production.
This will inevitably be true when the materials from which it was produced have undergone
decomposition. In other words, to obtain a sound and sweet fat, the raw material must be
sound and sweet; it must be processed speedily before it gets time to decompose; and this
must be done under clean and sanitary conditions. The fat thus obtained must be stored
under favorable conditions and its consumption should not be delayed.

The commercialy available soaps are shown in Figure 6.8.

used for specific purposes, for example colour and perfumes are added when used as
toilet soap.

353
Transparent soaps are prepared by first dissolving in alcohol and then evaporating the
excess alcohol. Floating soaps are prepared by beating air before it hardens during
manufacture. Certain antibacterial substance are also added for making medicinal soaps.
Potassium salts of fatty acids form soft soaps and are used as baby soaps.
ii) Detergents
Detergents are synthetic substances which are used as substitutes to soaps. Although synthetic
detergents vary considerably in their chemical structure, the molecules of all of them have
one common feature which they share with ordinary soaps. They are amphipathic, have a
large non-polar hydrocarbon end that is oil-soluble and a polar end that is water-soluble.
The C12-C18 alcohols are converted into the salts of alkyl hydrogen sulphate by treatment
with H2
SO4
. The resulting alkyl sulphates, when treated with NaOH, produce a detergent,
sodium alkyl sulphate.
For example, sodium lauryl sulphate, a very common detergent is obtained from lauryl
alcohol as shown in the following reaction.
CH (CH ) CH –OH + H SO CH – (CH ) CH –OSO H CH (CH ) CH –OSO Na 3 2 10 2 2 4 3 2 10 2 3 3 2 10 2 3
– + – –– NaOH
Lauryl alcohol Lauryl hydrogen sulphate Sodium lauryl sulphate
Detergents act in essentially the same way as soap does. However, they have certain
advantages over soap. For example, the sulphates retain their efficiency in hard water,
since the corresponding calcium or magnesium salts are soluble. Hence detergents can be
used in hard water. Detergents are neutral whereas soaps are basic. But, detergents are
not without drawbacks. For example, some are not biodegradable, which makes them
environmentally non-friendly. The new detergents are better in being more biodegradable
than the older generation.
iii) Saponification (Soap-making)
Soap-making (saponification) is one of the oldest chemical technologies. Man first boiled
goat tallow and wood ash to give a lathering and cleansing product. The goat tallow contained
the needed ester, and the wood ash the necessary alkali. Chemicals with the same reactive
groups are the main raw materials still used in traditional and modern soap manufacture.
Remember that saponification is the chemical process of breaking down an ester in presence
of alkali to form soap.

 Experiment 6.2
Laboratory Preparation of Soap
Objective: To prepare soap in the laboratory by the alkaline hydrolysis of fats
and oils.
Apparatus: Water-cooled condenser, 100 mL flask, Bunsen burner, Buchner funnel
ring stand, clamp, boiling chips and 400 mL beaker.
Chemicals: Animal fat (tallow) or vegetable oil, NaOH, ethanol and table salt.
Procedure:
1. Set up a reflux apparatus as shown in Figure 6.9.
2. Place 3 mL of vegetable oil or 3 g of animal fat (tallow) in the 250 mL distillation
flask.
3. Add about 15 mL of 20 % sodium hydroxide solution.
4. Add a few boiling chips and connect the flask to the condenser and gently reflux
the mixture over a small flame. Saponification is complete when a homogeneous
solution is obtained (in 30-45 minutes).
5. While the saponification is in progress, prepare a concentrated salt solution by
dissolving 50 g of NaCl in a 150 mL of water in a 400 mL beaker.
6. When saponification is complete, extinguish the flame and pour the mixture quickly
into the saturated NaCl solution (brine).
7. Stir the mixture thoroughly for several minutes.
8. Collect the precipitated soap on a Buchner funnel.
9. Wash the soap twice with 10 mL of ice-cold distilled water.Wait until it dries.

iv) Cleaning Action of Soap
Molecules of soap have two dissimilar ends. At one end is long carbon chain which is
hydrophobic or water repellant. The other end has carboxylate ion which is water soluble
end. So soap molecules have both polar and non-polar ends and, in addition, are big
enough for each end to display its own solubility behaviour. Such molecules are called
amphipathic. When they are dissolved in water, each non-polar end seeks a non-polar
environment in line with rule of “like dissolves like”. Therefore, many nonpolar ends clump
together to form the micelles as shown in Figure 6.10.

projected polar ends, these micelles dissolve in water and are washed away. In this way
soaps act as cleaning agents.

Unit Summary
• Carboxylic acids are compounds with a –COOH functional group.
• Because of the –COOH functional group, carboxylic acids are polar
compounds and can form hydrogen bondings with water and among
themselves.
• The common names of carboxylic acids are based on their origins in
nature whereas their IUPAC names are created by replacing the ending
“e” of the corresponding alkane, or alkyne by “oic acid.”
• Carboxylic acids are generally prepared by the oxidation of corresponding
primary alcohols.
• Esters are mildly polar compounds that are widely distributed in nature.
• Esters are named according to both the common name system and the
IUPAC system.
• In a laboratory, esters can be prepared from a reaction between a
carboxylic acid and an alcohol. The process requires an acid catalyst and
heating.
• Fats and oils are esters of long-chain carboxylic acid with glycerol.
• Soaps are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic acids. They
can be prepared by the saponification of fats or oils, using a base (NaOH
or KOH).
• One of the main difference between soaps and detergents is that the
detergents can be used in hard water, whereas soaps form scum in hard
water
