Polymers are macro (large) molecules made from smaller repeating units called
monomers. Hence, monomers are the building blocks of polymers. A polymer might
be made from identical monomers or different types of monomers. Homopolymers are
made from only one type of monomer. For example, polyethylene is synthesized by
the polymerization of one type monomer, ethene (ethylene).

Assume that 2000 students are standing in the school play ground and each student is
treated as a monomer unit of polyethylene. The students are asked to hold the hands of
each other in a linear fashion. In this way, the students will form a linear chain of
polyethylene molecule. Calculate the molecular mass of the polyethylene molecule, using
this analogy.
Copolymers are prepared by polymerizing more than one kind of monomer unit. For
instance, ethene (H2C=CH2) and propene (H2C=CH–CH3) can be copolymerized to
produce a polymer that has two kinds of repeating units:

Copolymers are classified as random or regular, based on the way the monomers are
arranged along the polymer chain (Figure 6.1.).

Random polymers contain repeating units arranged in a random fashion. Regular
polymers contain a sequence of monomers in regular alternating repeating units.

On the basis of their source, polymers are classified as synthetic and natural. Natural
polymers, as their name indicates, are found in nature. For example, proteins,
carbohydrates, nucleic acids and natural rubber are natural polymers. You will study
them in the last section of this unit.
Synthetic polymers are man–made polymers. Most synthetic polymers are organic
compounds. Some of the examples are nylon, polyester (Dacron), Teflon, Bakelite,
polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride.

 6.2 POLYMERIZATION
After completing this subunit, you will be able to:
• explain polymerization;
• mention the two types of polymerization;
• explain how addition polymerization takes place; and
• explain how condensation polymerization takes place.
Polymerization is the process by which monomer units combine together to form
polymers. Polymerization can be carried out either through addition polymerization or
condensation polymerization.
Perform the following activity. Then, share your ideas with the rest of the class.
a Distinguish between addition and condensation reactions.
b Prepare list of monomers used in polymerization and have a look at their structures
and functional groups. Explain their special features that allow them to form large
molecules.
6.2.1 Addition Polymerization
Addition polymerization requires a large number of monomer molecules which can be
polymerized by addition reactions. This type of polymerization is also known as chaingrowth polymerization.
For example, the addition polymerization of many ethylene molecules yields
polyethylene and that of styrene molecules gives polystyrene.

the polymer (PVC) by the molar mass of monomer.

Number of monomer units = Molar mass of the polymer

62.5 g/mol =
C = 12 × 2 = 24
H = 1 × 3 = 3
Cl = 35.5 × 1 = 35.5 = 62.5 g/mol
Which means that 2128 vinyl chloride molecules combine to form the polymer.
6.2.2 Condensation Polymerization
Condensation polymerization involves the combination of monomer molecules, with the
elimination of simple molecules like water. This polymerization is also known as step
growth polymerization. In order to produce a condensation polymer, the monomers
involved must have two or more functional groups.
Can you give examples of condensation polymers?
Consider what happens when an alcohol with two –OH groups, HO–R –OH, reacts
with a dicarboxylic acid, HOOC–R¢–COOH. In this case the ester formed still has a
reactive group at both ends of the molecule.

will study the preparation and uses of Bakelite in this subunit. In 1911, Bakelite was
followed by rayon, the first synthetic fiber. Despite these important developments, it
was not until World War II that significant changes took place in the polymer industry.
Since then, the polymer industry has continued to evolve as one of the fastest growing
industries in the world.

Thermoplastics and Thermosetting Polymers
What is the basic difference between thermoplastics and thermosetting
polymers?
Based on their response to heat, polymers can be divided into two groups:
thermoplastics and thermosetting plastics.
Thermoplastics soften on heating and can be moulded into different shapes. They
become hard on cooling. The process of heating and cooling can be repeated many
times without causing any change in their properties. For example, polyethylene,
polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, Teflon, polymethyl methacrylate, nylon and
polyester (Dacron) are thermoplastics.
Thermosetting plastics can be moulded into different shapes by heating and they
become hard when cooled. However, once solidified and set they cannot be softened
or remoulded by heating. For example, Bakelite is a thermosetting plastic.
What makes this difference?
Thermoplastics consist of linear or slightly branched molecules which do not
chemically bond with each other when heated. Instead, the polymer molecules are
held together by weak Van der Waals forces. In contrast, thermosetting plastics
consist of chain molecules that chemically bond, or cross-link, with each other when
heated.
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
280
Which forces are stronger, Van der Waals forces or covalent bonds? Why?
Thermoplastic materials can be recycled, whereas thermosetting cannot.

Impacts of Synthetic Polymers on Environment

items are made. Discuss the impact of these materials on the environment. Share your
ideas with the rest of your classmates.
2. What should be done to alleviate the problems caused by plastics?
Activity 6.6
POLYMERS (UNIT 6)
281
It is common to use plastic bags to carry materials that we buy from supermarkets or
shops.
If you discarded plastic materials to the environment, what problems would
they cause to the environment?
Synthetic polymers or plastics are extensively used throughout the world. Although
they are very important for humans, there are many environmental concerns about
their use. Study of fields like environmental science and environmental chemistry
are mainly concerned with protecting the environment.
The production of plastic produces substantial amounts of toxic chemicals (e.g.
ethylene oxide, benzene and xylenes) to air and water. Many of the toxic
chemicals released in plastic production can cause cancer and birth defects and
damage the nervous system, blood, kidneys and immune systems. These chemicals
can also cause serious damage to environment.
Direct disposal (littering or dumping) and incineration (burning) of these wastes is
a common practice. Each is harmful to the health of people and the environment.
For example, dumping plastic wastes in urban drainage systems pollutes water
courses and causes flooding. When these water bodies are contaminated, they
carry disease into the household. The burning of plastics encourages airborne
pollution, the majority of which is extremely toxic and can cause a host of health
problems (cancer, asthma, etc.). Although landfilling and recycling reduce the
waste problem, each has considerably negative consequences: landfills leak and
often contaminate the ground water with toxic liquids and residues. Recycling of
plastic is associated with skin and respiratory problems, resulting from exposure
to and inhalation of toxic fumes, especially hydrocarbons and residues released
during the process.
One of the features that we value in plastics, their durability, is also a problem for
us. When plastics are disposed into the environment, they remain there for a very
long time, degrading very slowly, and continue to pollute our environment.

Rubber is an example of elastomer type of polymer, in which the polymer can return
to its original shape after being stretched. Natural rubber is a soft and sticky solid.
Rubber softens in hot weather and gets hard in cold weather. It is soluble in organic
solvents such as carbon disulfide, petrol, ether and so on.
The properties of natural rubber are improved by introducing cross linkages between
its polymer chains. This can be achieved by heating natural rubber with sulphur. This
process is known as vulcanization. Vulcanization establishes cross-links between linear
polymer chains.

6.4.3 Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are compounds that contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Green
plants produce carbohydrates by photosynthesis. In this process, carbon dioxide from
air and water from the soil are the reactants and sunlight absorbed by chlorophyll is
the energy source.

Earlier, carbohydrates that were purified and analysed had molecular formulas that
corresponds to CnH2nOn or Cn(H2O)n. As a result, they were considered to be
"hydrates of carbon" or carbohydrates. However, examination of the structures of
POLYMERS (UNIT 6)
287
carbohydrates shows that this view is inaccurate. Even though this definition is no
more used, the name carbohydrate is still used.
Today, carbohydrates are defined as polyhydroxy aldehydes, polyhydroxy ketones or
compounds that yield such substance upon hydrolysis. For example, glucose is a
polyhydroxy aldehyde, and fructose is a polyhydroxy ketones.

five and six carbon atoms are called tetroses, pentoses, and hexoses, respectively.
Monosaccharides are classified as aldoses and ketoses based on the carbonyl group
present.
Aldoses are monosaccharides that contain an aldehyde functional group. Ketoses are
monosaccharides that contain a ketone functional group.
Monosaccharides are often classified by both their number of carbon atoms and their
functional group.
A six-carbon monosaccharide with an aldehyde functional group is an aldohexose. A
five-carbon monosaccharide with a ketone functional group is a ketopentose.
Monosaccharides are also often called sugars. The word sugar is associated with
“sweetness” and most monosaccharides have a sweet taste. Both monosaccharides
and disaccharides are called sugars.

Note that glucose and galactose differ only in the configuration of the – OH group
and – H group on carbon-4. Glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide in nature.
It is called blood sugar because blood contains dissolved glucose. Its concentration in
the blood ranges from 70-100 mg per 100 ml of blood. Cells use this glucose as a
primary energy source.
In the human body, galactose is synthesized from glucose in the mammary glands for
use in lactose (milk sugar). Fructose is the sweetest-tasting of all sugars and is found
in many fruits. It is also present in honey, in equal amounts with glucose.
From the third to the sixth carbon the structure of fructose is identical to that of
glucose. Differences at carbons 1 and 2 are related to the presence of a ketone
functional group in fructose and of an aldehyde functional group in glucose.

Experimental evidence indicates that, for monosaccharides containing five or more
carbon atoms, their open-chain structures are in equilibrium with two cyclic structures
and the cyclic structures are the dominant forms at equilibrium. The cyclic forms of
monsaccharides result from the ability of their carbonyl group to react intramolecularly
(within the molecule) with the hydroxyl group. The result is a cyclic hemi-acetal or
cyclic hemi-ketal.
If a six member ring is formed, it is called pyranose. The pyranose ring is formed by
the reaction of the –OH group on carbon-5 with the carbonyl group on carbon-1.
Is there any structural similarity between Pyran and Pyranose?

b Disaccharides
They are dimers made up of two monosaccharide molecules. The monosaccharides
may be either the same or different. The monosaccharides are joined by glycosidic
linkage between anomeric carbon of one monosaccharide and the – OH group of the
other.
The most glycosidic linkage is between the 4-hydroxyl group of one monsaccharide
and the α or β position of the anomeric carbon. This kind of linkage is called α-1,4-
or β-1,4-glycosidic linkage or bond depending on the configuration at the anomeric
carbon atom.
Maltose
Maltose, often called malt sugar, is produced whenever the polysaccharide starch
breaks down. This happens when seed germinates in plants and during starch
digestion in human beings.
Maltose is made of two glucose units, one of which must be α-glucose and the other
can be α or β glucose. Note that since the orientation of OH at carbon-1 is either α
or β, we represent it by ( OH).

first glucose unit (in the α-configuration) and to carbon-4 of the second glucose
unit.

Maltose and cellobiose have different biological behaviors. Maltase, the enzyme that
breaks the glucose-glucose α-1,4-linkage present in maltose, is found both in the
human body and yeast. As a result, maltose is digested easily by humans and is
readily fermented by yeast. Both the human body and yeast lack the enzyme
cellobiase needed to break the glucose-glucose β-1,4-linkage of cellobiose.
Therefore, cellobiose cannot be digested by humans or fermented by yeast.

c Polysaccharides
Are polysaccharides condensation polymers or addition polymers?
Polysaccharides are polymers. They consist of a large number of monosaccharide
units bonded together by glycosidic bonds. The three important polysaccharides, all
made up of glucose units, are cellulose, starch and glycogen.
Are polysaccharides homopolymers or copolymers?
Cellulose
Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide. It is the structural component of the
cell walls of plants. Structurally, cellulose is a linear (unbranched) glucose polymer in
which the glucose units are linked by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds.

Cellulose is not a source of nutrition for humans because humans lack the enzyme
cellulase which can hydrolyze the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds and produce free glucose
from cellulose.
However, animals such as horses, cows and sheep contain bacteria in their intestine
that produce cellulase and produce free glucose from cellulose. Thus, grasses and
other plant materials are sources of nutrition for these animals. Cotton is composed of
pure cellulose. The cotton fibre forms around the seeds of the cotton plant as
indicated in Figure 6.12 and is designed to help carry the seeds long distances on the

clothing.

2. What is the simplest method to differentiate woollen fibre from a cotton fibre?
Starch
Starch is used for energy storage in plants. If excess glucose enters a plant cell, it is
converted to starch and stored for later use.
Starch can be separated into two principal polysaccharides, amylose and amylopectin.
Amylose is a straight-chain glucose polymer and accounts for 20-25% of starch. The
glucose units in amylose are connected by α-1,4-glycosidic bonds. The number of
glucose units present in amylose chain depends on the source of the starch.

Starch (Amylose)
Amylopectin is a highly branched glucose polymer, which accounts for 75-80% of
starch. Similar to the case in amylose, all the linkages in amylopectin are α-linkages.
A branch occurs in amylopectin about once in every 25-30 glucose units. The branch
points involve α-1,6-linkages. Because of the branching, amylopectin has a large
average molecular mass than the linear amylose.

Note that all of the glycosdic linkages in starch (both amylose and amylopectin) are
of the α-type. In amylose, they are all α-1,4-linkages and in amylopectin both α-1,4
and α-1,6-likages are present.
Glycogen
It is a glucose storage polysaccharide in humans and animals. It is called animal
starch. Liver cells and muscle cells are the storage sites for glycogen in humans.
POLYMERS (UNIT 6)
299
Like amylopectin, glycogen units are joined by α-1,4- and α-1,6-glycosdic bonds.
However, glycogen is about three times more highly branched than amylopectin.
When excess glucose is present in the blood, the liver and muscle tissues convert the
excess glucose to glycogen, which is then stored in these tissues. If the glucose blood
level decreases, some stored glycogen is hydrolyzed back to glucose.
Exercise 6.10

You can use the characteristics in column B more than once.

3. Humans can digest starch but not cellulose. Why?
6.4.4 Proteins
What are proteins?
The name protein comes from the Greek word “proteios” which means “primary”.
This indicates the relative importance of these compounds. All proteins contain
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. Many proteins also contain sulphur.
Proteins are made by the polymerization of the twenty naturally occurring amino acids.
An amino acid is a compound that contains both an amino (–NH2) group and a
carboxylic acid (–COOH) group.
The amino acids found in proteins are always α-amino acids (the amino group is
attached to the carbon atom adjacent to the carboxyl group).
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 12

The structural formula for an α-amino acid is:

The R group present in an α- amino acid is called the amino acid side chain. The
nature of this side chain distinguishes α- amino acids from each other. Based on the
side chain polarity, amino acids can be grouped into four categories:
1. Nonpolar amino acids;
2. Polar neutral amino acids;
3. Polar acidic amino acids; and
4. Polar basic amino acids.
Nonpolar amino acids
Nonpolar amino acids contain one amino group, one carboxyl group, and a nonpolar
side chain. When they are incorporated into a protein, these amino acids are
hydrophobic or “water-fearing” and are not attracted to water molecules. They are
generally found on the interior of proteins, where there is limited contact with water.
There are eight nonpolar amino acids.

Physical Properties of Amino Acids
Amino acids have the following properties.
i) They have high melting points.
ii) They are colourless crystalline substances.
iii) They are soluble in water but insoluble in nonpolar solvents.
Thus, they resemble ionic compounds. This occurs due to the fact that amino acids
contain both an acid (–COOH) and a base (–NH2) functional groups. These acids
and basic groups react with each other to form a dipolar ion or internal salt. The
dipolar ion of an amino acid is called zwitterion.
A zwitterion has no net charge.

Zwitterion form
A zwitterion structure changes when the pH of a solution containing an amino acid is
changed from neutral either to acidic (low pH), by adding an acid such as HCl, or to
basic (high pH), by adding a base such as NaOH. In acidic solution, the zwitterion
accepts a proton (H+) to form a positively charged ion.

Form a group and discuss each of the following questions.
1. Why amino acids form zwitterions?
2. How many different tripeptides can be obtained by various combinations of three
amino acid residues?
3. How do amino acids join together to form proteins?
4. What type of polymerization is it?
5. What are the differences between different proteins?
After the discussion, share your ideas with the rest of the class
A peptide (amide) is a bond formed between the carboxyl group of one amino acid
and the amino group of another amino acid.
If two amino acids are allowed to react, the carboxyl group of one amino acid reacts
with the amino group of the other amino acid. The products are a molecule containing
the two amino acids linked by an amide bond or a peptide bond and water.

A compound containing two amino acids joined by a peptide bond is called a
dipeptide. Either end of the dipeptide can undergo a condensation reaction with
another amino acid to form a tripeptide, tetrapeptide and so on.
Recall that, in the preparation of nylon 66, adipic acid contains two acid functional
groups and hexamethylene diamine contains two amine functional groups.
A polypeptide is a sequence of amino acids, containing up to 50 amino acid units, in
which the amino acids are joined together through amide (peptide) bonds. Proteins
are polypeptides that contain more than 50 amino acid units.
Are proteins condensation polymers or addition polymers? Which small
molecule is mostly expelled in the synthesis of protein?
Proteins have many functions, as shown in Table 6.2.
Table 6.2 Some Functions of Proteins.
Type of protein Example Function
Enzymes amylase Promotes the breakdown of starch
to the simple sugar glucose.
Structural proteins keratin, collagen Promotes the formation of hair, wool,
nails, horns, tendons and cartilage.
Contractile proteins actin, myosin Contracting fibers in muscle.
Hormones insulin, glucagon Regulates use of blood sugar.
Storage proteins ferritin Stores iron in spleen.
Transport proteins hemoglobin Carries oxygen in blood.
serum albumin Carries fatty acids in blood.
Immunological proteins antibodies Defends the body from foreign
invaders.
By convention the sequence of amino acids in a peptide is written with the N-terminal
amino acid at the left and the C-terminal amino acid at the right. The individual amino
acids within a peptide chain are called amino acid residues.

Unit Summary
• Monomers are the building blocks of polymers.
• Homopolymers are made from identical monomers, and copolymers are
synthesized from more than one kind of monomer.
• Based on their sources, polymers can be classified as synthetic or natural.
Synthetic polymers are man-made, while natural polymers exist naturally.
• Polymerization is the process of combining monomer units to form large
molecules called polymers.
• Polymerization can be effected through either addition polymerization or
condensation polymerization.
• Each of the following polymers are made by addition polymerization.
 Polyethylene
 Polypropylene

 Carbohydrates, and
 Proteins.
• Thermoplastics soften on heating and can be molded into different
shapes, and the process of heating and cooling can be repeated several
times, but once thermosetting plastics are solidified they cannot be
softened or remolded on heating.
• Synthetic polymers pollute the environment during their preparations, use
and disposal.
• Monosaccharides are the building blocks of carbohydrates.
• Proteins are made from the twenty naturally occurring amino acids
