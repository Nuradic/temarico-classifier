In Grade 9 chemistry, you learned that not all chemical reactions proceed at equal
speed. For example, rusting of iron could start while rippening of fruits may be completed
in a few days. On the other hand, weathering of stone may take more than a decade
and the brakedown of plastics in the environment takes more than hundred years.
However, other reactions, like the combustion of gasoline or the explosion of gunpowder
occur in a few seconds. Can you add more examples from your daily life?
Now, let us define Chemical kinetics. Chemical kinetics is the area of chemistry concerned
with the speeds, or rates, at which reactions occur. The word “kinetic” suggests movement
or change. Chemical kinetics refers to the rate of reaction, which is the change over
times in the concentration of a reactant or a product.
In this unit, you will study the fundamental concepts of chemical kinetics. You will
explore rate of reaction, factors affecting rate of reaction, theories of rate of reaction,
rate equations or rate laws, and reaction mechanisms.
Peter Waage (1833–1900) and Cato Guldberg (1836–
1902) were Norwegian chemists. They pioneered the
development of chemical kinetics in 1864 by
formulating the law of mass action.

CHEMICAL KINETICS

From your background knowledge of chemistry, do you remember the definition of a
chemical reaction? What is the difference between reversible and irreversible chemical
reactions? Consider a flask containing hydrogen, iodine, and hydrogen iodide. The
hydrogen iodide, HI is decomposing more rapidly than the H2 and I
2 can combine to
produce it. The chemical equation representing the formation of HI from this reaction
of hydrogen and iodine is represented as:
H2(g) + I2(g) —→ 2HI(g)
The rate of appearance of HI in the above reaction is defined as the rate of reaction
from left to right.
For the diappearnace of HI,
2HI(g) —→ H2(g) + I2(g)
the rate of disappearance of HI is then defined as the rate of reaction from right to left.
How do you think that the rate of reaction is measured?
Rate of reaction is the change in concentration of a reactant or a product over a given
period of time. During the course of a reaction, the concentrations of the reactants
decrease while those of the products increase. Thus, the rate of a reaction is calculated
by dividing the change in the concentrations of reactants or products by the time taken
for the change to occur.
For a simple reaction,
A —→ B
the rate of reaction is expressed in terms of a reactant concentration as
r = – 
f i ∆ − [A] [A] [A] = − ∆ ∆ t t ...(4.1)
where r is rate of reaction, A is a reactant, B is a product, [A]i
 and [A]f
 are initial and
final concentration of A respectively, ∆[A] is change in concentration of A and ∆t is the
change in time. Note that concentration is usually expressed in mole per litre.
From equation 4.1, can you determine the unit for expressing rate of reaction?
The rate of a reaction can be expressed in units of mol L–1 s–1. The final concentration
of the reactant, [A]f
, is smaller than the initial concentration of the reactant, [A]i
 Thus,
the difference, ∆[A] = [A]f
 – [A]i
, is negative. This indicates that the reactant is being
consumed. However, the rate of a reaction is a positive quantity. Thus, a negative sign
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 11
202
is introduced in the rate expression to make the rate positive.
Can you write a rate of reaction in terms of concentration of a product?
In terms of product concentration, the rate of a reaction is given by:
r = f i ∆ − [B] [B] [B] = ∆ ∆ t t ...(4.2)
where [B] is the molar concentration of a product in moles per litre, mol L–1. For a
given product, the final concentration of B, [B]f
, is greater than the initial concentration
of B, [B]i
. Thus, the difference, ∆B = [B]f
 – [B]i is positive, and the rate of a reaction
is also positive. Therefore, there is no need to introduce a negative sign to the rate
expression when rate of a reaction is calculated by using product concentration. This
change can be shown using a graph.
Reaction Rate and Stoichiometry
You have seen that, for stoichiometrically simple reactions of the type A —→ B, the rate
of reaction can be expressed either in terms of the decrease in reactant concentration
over time, –[A] / ∆t, or in terms of the increase in product concentration with time,
∆[B]/∆t. For more complex reactions, you must be careful in writing the rate expressions.
Consider, for example, the reaction
2A —→ B
For two moles of A that disappear one mole of B is formed. That is, the rate of
disappearance of A is twice as the rate of appearance of B. The reaction rate may be
written as:
1 [A] [B] or

4.1.1 Determination of Rate of Reaction
You studied in the previous grade that there are different ways in which reactions are
monitored. These include change of colour, volume of gas evolved, amount of precipitate
formed and loss or gain of mass. In addition, you learned how to draw a graph showing
how the rate of a chemical reaction changes over time and how the rate relates to the
slope.

e How long did it take for 40 cm3 of carbon dioxide to form?
f Why does the rate of reaction gradually slow down?
Share your ideas with the rest of the class.
The rate of reaction can be determined both quantitatively and qualitatively. Qualitatively,
an idea about the rate of reaction can be obtained by observing either the speed of
disappearance of the reactants or the speed of appearance (formation) of the products.
Example 4.2
In aqueous solutions, molecular bromine reacts with formic acid (HCOOH) as
follows:
Br2(aq) + HCOOH(aq) → 2Br–(aq) + 2H+(aq) + CO2(aq)
Molecular bromine is reddish-brown in colour. All the other species in the reaction
are colourless. As the reaction progresses, the concentration of Br2 steadily decreases
and the colour fades. Measuring the change (decrease) in bromine concentration
over time measuring at some initial time and then again at some final time) allows
us to determine the average rate of the reaction during that interval.

400.0 0.0296 1.04 x 10–5 3.51 x 10–3
Now, you can calculate the average rate at the end of the first 50-second (s) time
interval, as follows:
5 (0.0101 0.0120)M 3.80 10 M / s
50.0 s
r − − =− = ×
If the first 100 s is chosen as the time interval, the average rate will be given by:
5 (0.00846 0.0120)M 3.54 10 M / s
100.0s
− − r = − = ×
The above calculations demonstrate that the average rate of reaction depends on the
time interval we choose. Thus, in general, the rate of reaction at the begining is fast and
it decreases as the reaction proceeds.
What could be the possible reason for this decrease in the rate of reaction?

Instantaneous rate of reaction is defined as the rate of a reaction for a given instant of
time and it is calculated by drawing a tangent to the graph at that instant of time.
Earlier, we measured the rates of reaction that occurred in a few seconds. We can also
measure the rates of very fast reactions occurring in micro (10–6) or nano (10–9) seconds.
For example, the rate of electron transfer in photosynthesis can be measured.

)

try the same activity with oil, instead of water. Now, discuss each of the following
questions and share your findings with the rest of the class.
1. Why do you think sugar crystals dissolve more easily in hot water than in cold water?
2. Explain why powdered sugar dissolved easily as compared to equivalent amounts of
sugar crystals?
In general, different chemical reactions have different rates. Even a chemical reaction
involving the same reactants may have different rates under different conditions. Change
in temperature, concentration, nature of reactant, surface area and availability of a
catalyst, result in changes in rate of reaction.
Consider the Experiment 4.2 to study the effect of the nature of reactants on rate of
reaction.

with HCl.
3. What do you learn from this experiment?
4. Perform a similar activity using different metals such as aluminium, and zinc. In
which case do you expect the reaction to be faster and why?
The rate of a reaction depends on the chemical nature of the substances participating
in the reaction. The combination of two oppositely charged ions usually occurs very
rapidly. For example, the reaction of an acid with a base is,
H3O+ + OH–
 → 2H2O
The acid-base reaction of HCl and NaOH is much faster than the decomposition of
hydrogen peroxide, which involves the reorganization of molecules.

 Experiment 4.3
2H2O2 → 2H2O + O2
Even similar reactions may have different rates under the same conditions. For example,
consider the reaction of calcium with water compared with the reaction of iron with
water. The reaction of calcium with cold water is moderate, while that of iron is very
slow infact iron reacts with steam to form iron oxide.

Procedure: Repeat Experiment 4.1 but use 20 g of small cubical chalk and then
powdered chalk in place of marble chips.
Observations: In which case is the evolution of gas is faster?
Observations and analysis:
1. Compare the rate curve, average rate and reaction rate at 2 minutes with that
of Experiment 4.1. Explain your observations.
2. Sketch a graph for the consumption of each size of chalk (cube chalk and
powdered chalk) against time on the same graph sheet.
3. State the conclusion of the experiment.
Which form of Zinc metal is easier to dissolve in dilute HCl, large pieces of Zn or
powdered Zn? Why?
CHEMICAL KINETICS
213
 Experiment 4.4
A reaction between substances that are in different physical phases (solid, liquid, gas) is
called a heterogeneous reaction. In this case, bringing the reacting molecules or ions
together may be difficult. For example, the reaction between steam and red hot iron,
proceeds very slowly if the iron is in one large block, but it goes rapidly if the metal is
powdered and spread out so as to expose a large surface to the steam.
3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)
In general, the area of contact between the phases ditermines the rate of reaction in
heterogenous reaction. When the size of particles is minimized, contact between the
atoms, ions, or molecules in the solid state maximizes with those in a different phase.
A reaction of substances when both are in the gaseous or liquid phase, is referred to as
a homogeneous reaction. The question of contact between the reactive molecules in a
homogeneous reaction is not an important one, for the molecules and ions are free to
move and collisions are frequent.
Consider Experiment 4.4 to study the effect of concentration of acid on the rate of
reaction between CaCO3
 and hydrochloric acid.

more vigorous? Explain.
2. Which of the two reactions will produce more carbon dioxide? Explain your
answer.
3. What would happen to the rate curve and average rate if:
a 1M HCl is replaced with 4 M dilute HCl? Explain.
b 1M HCl is replaced with 0.5 M dilute HCl? Explain.
4 Sketch a graph for each of 0.5 M, 1 M, 2 M and 4 M dilute HCl against time
on the same graph sheet.
Why does wood burn more rapidly in pure oxygen than in air?
When the concentration of one or more reactants increases, rate of reaction increases.
This is because increasing the concentration produces more contacts between the reacting
particles, which results in increasing the rate of reaction. In the case of reactions that
involve gaseous reactants, an increase in pressure increases the concentration of the
gases which leads to an increase in the rate of reaction. However, pressure change has
no effect on the rate of reaction if the reactants are either solids or liquids.
The examples of rate of reaction being affected by different factors can be seen in both
biotic and abiotic components. For example, growth of cancer cells depends on the
nutrient levels, temperature, pH, etc. The rate of growth of cancer cells has been
measured as a function of glucose (nutrient) concentration. The cells grow as the glucose
concentration decreases.

Temperature usually has a major effect on the rate of reaction. Molecules at higher
temperatures have more thermal energy. Generally, an increase in the temperature of a
reaction mixture increases the rate of reaction of chemical reactions. This is because as
the temperature of the reaction mixture raises, the average kinetic energy of the reacting
particles increases. So, they collide more frequently and with greater energy.
The effect of temperature on rate of reaction can be experienced in our dailylife. For
example,
a the food is kept in refrigerator to slow down the rate of decomposition of food; and
b during heart surgery, the body of patient is cooled to slowdown the rates of
biological reactions.
Temperature not only affects the rate of reaction but can even change the course of a
reaction. For example,
At 200°C,
NH4NO3(s) → N2O(g) + 2H2O(g)

A catalyst is a substance that changes reaction rate by providing a different reaction
mechanism one with a lower activation energy, Ea
, which is the minimum energy needed
to start a chemical reaction. A catalyst may undergo intermediate physical changes and
it may even form temporary chemical bonds with the reactants but it is recovered
unchanged in original form at the end of the reaction. Although a catalyst speeds up the
reaction, it does not alter the position of equilibrium. The effect of catalysts on the rate
of chemical reaction is illustrated in Figure 4.5.

Chemical catalysts can be either positive or negative. Positive Catalyst increases the rate
of reaction by lowering the Activation Energy, Ea
.
Example (1) : 2SO2(g) + O2(g) → 2SO3(g) ; V2O5(s) as catalyst.
Negative Catalyst or Inhibitors decreases the rate of reaction by increasing the value of Ea
.
Example (2) : OCl–(aq) + I–(aq) → OI–(aq) + Cl–(aq) ; OH–(aq) as inhibitor.
Example(1) represents heterogeneous catalysts as state of reactants and catalyst is
different while example (2) represents homogeneous catalyst as both reactants and
catalyst are in same state.
The role of a catalyst is highly specific to a particular reaction.
Example : CO(g) + H2(g) → CH4(g) + H2O(g) ; Ni(s) is used as catalyst.
CO(g) + H2(g) → HCHO(g); Cu (s) is used as catalyst.
A substance that catalyzes one reaction may have no effect on another reaction, even
if that reaction is very similar. Many of the most highly specific catalysts are those
designed by nature. The chemical reactions in living things are controlled by biochemical
catalysts called enzymes.

At the end of this section, you should be able to:
• state collision theory;

• describe how collision theory can be used to explain changes in reaction rate;
• state the transition-state theory;
• define activated complex (transition state);
• describe how transition-state theory explains changes in reaction rate; and
• sketch and label the energy profiles of reactions that are exothermic and endothermic.
Two important theories help us to explain why different reactions occur at different
rates. These are the collision theory and the transition-state theory. These two theories
are distinct but in complete agreement, each emphasizing different aspects of reaction
processes.

Concentration and Collision Theory
The fundamental concept of the collision theory of rate of reaction is that, in order for
a reaction to occur between reacting species (atoms, ions or molecules), they must first
collide (come in contact). The rate of reaction is directly proportional to the number of
collisions per second (the frequency of collision).
number of collisions Rate α
second
According to collision theory, the more collisions there are, the faster the rate of reaction
would be. However, not all collisions between reacting species result in a reaction. This
is because collisions between reactants can be either effective or ineffective. Effective
collisions are collisions that result in a reaction to form the desired products. Ineffective
collisions are collisions that do not result in a reaction to form the desired products.
In order for a collision between reactants to be effective, the reacting species must be
in proper orientation to each other at the time of collision, they must collide with
sufficient energy to break or rearrange bonds. The minimum energy required for a
reaction to occur during a collision of reacting species is called the activation energy, Ea
.
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 11
222
Postulates of collision theory are summarized below.
For a reaction to occur between reactants:
1. The particles of the reacting substances must collide.
2. The particles of the reacting species must have proper orientation.
3. The particles of the reactants must collide with energy greater than or equal to
the energy of activation.
According to collision theory, only collisions with proper orientation of reacting species
possessing sufficient energy result in a reaction. The collision can either be linear or nonlinear (bent).
a Linear b Bent
Figure 4.6 Orientation of molecules.
Generally, Ea for activated complex formed in linear orientation is less than that is
formed in bent orientation. Hence, orientation (a) is favoured over orientation (b).
Concentration is one of the factors that influence the rate of reaction of a chemical
reaction. Collision theory accounts for the observed increase in the rate of any reaction
when the concentrations of reactants are increased. Increasing the concentrations of the
reacting species results in higher number of collisions per unit time, and the reaction rate
is correspondingly higher.
Temperature and Collision Theory
According to the kinetic molecular theory, the average kinetic energy of the particles of
a substance is directly proportional to the absolute temperature. As the temperature of
the reacting species is raised, the average kinetic energy of the reacting particles increases
considerably. This causes the particles of the reactants to collide more frequently and
with greater energy. This results in an increase in reaction rate.

Share your ideas with the rest of the class.
Transition-state theory was developed in 1935 simultaneously by Henry Eyring, Meredith
Gwynne Evans and Michael Polanyi. It is also referred to as “activated-complex theory”.
According to transition-state theory, the collision between two reacting species results
in the formation of an activated complex or transition state. An activated complex or
transition state is a short-lived, high energy state species that is temporarily formed by
the collision of reactant molecules before they form products.
These species can either form products or fall apart to give the original reactants. In the
activated complex, the original bonds are lengthened and weakened, and the new bonds
are only partially formed. Remember that chemical reactions involve the formation and
breaking of chemircal bonds and are accompanied by changes in potential energy, which
is related to bond energy. Let us consider the reaction:
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 11
224
A2 + B2 → 2AB
where A2 and B2 are the reactants, and AB is a the product. Refer to Figure 4.7. As
the reactants, A2 and B2, approach each other and collide, they begin climbing up the
left side of the potential-energy hill, or barrier. If they have less energy than the energy
of activation, Ea
, they fail to climb the barrier and, instead, roll back down its left side.
In this case, no reaction occurs.
If, however, they have energy that is at least equal to the energy of activation, they climb
the barrier, roll down the other side, and convert to product.
In this concept, the level of activation energy required for a reaction is seen as the height
of a barrier between the reactants and products. To convert from the reactant condition
to the product condition, particles must climb the barrier.
The potential-energy curves in Figure 4.7 include representations of the barrier. Potential Energy

As shown in Figure 4.7, the activated complex corresponds to the peak of the energy
barrier. According to transition-state theory, the rate of reaction depends on the rate at

which reactants can climb to the top of the barrier and form an activated complex. On
the other hand, the activation energy, Ea
, is the energy that must be absorbed by the
reactants to allow them to reach the transition state or the activated complex and cross
the energy barrier.
For the exothermic reaction illustrated in Figure 4.7(a), the products have lower energy
than the reactants and the standard reaction enthalpy is less than zero ∆Hr
o < O.
In Figure 4.7(b), the thus energy of the products is higher than that of the reactants,
thus for an endothermic reaction, ∆H°r > 0.

4.3.1 Order of Reaction and Rate Constant
You have studied that rate of a reaction increases with increase in concentration of
reactants. Form a group and discuss each of the following questions and share your ideas
with the rest of the class.
1. How many folds does the rate of reaction increases if concentration of a reactant is
doubled?
2. Do all the reactants affect reaction rate in equivalent amount?
3. Does the reaction rate changes in the same ratio every time?
4. Why do you think chemists want to know the order of a reaction and the rate
constant for a reaction?
The rate law or rate equation for a chemical reaction is an equation which links the
reaction rate with the concentrations or pressures of reactants and certain constant
parameters (normally rate coefficients and partial reaction order). To determine the
rate equation for a particular system, one combines the reaction rate with a mass
balance for the system.
For a simple reaction,
A → B
Where A is reactant and B is the product. The rate law or rate equation for this reaction
is written as:
Rate α [A]x or Rate = k[A]x ...(4.4)
where [A] expresses the concentration of A (usually in moles per liter) and k is the rate
constant of the reaction, and “x” is the order of the reaction. Note that “x” is not
stoichiometric coefficient in the balanced equation and it is determined experimentally.
The order of reaction is the power to which the reactant's concentration is raised in the
rate law expression.
For reactions involving more than one reactant, the order of a reaction is the sum of the
powers to which all concentrations are raised in the rate law expression. For the general
reaction.
aA + bB → cC + dD
CHEMICAL KINETICS
227
we can write the rate law expression as:
 r = k[A]x
 [B]y ...(4.5)
The reaction is xth order in A, yth order in B, and (x + y)
th order overall. Note that
the order of a reaction is not necessarily the same as the stoichiometric coefficients in
the balanced equation for the reaction. The value of the rate constant, k, depends on
conditions such as temperature, concentration and surface area of the adsorbent or light
irradiation.
Consider a reaction with the rate equation,
r = k[A]2 [B]
The reaction with the rate equation given above is described as “second-order in A” and
“first-order in B.” The overall reaction order is described as a third-order reaction
overall, because the sum of the exponents on [A] and [B] is 3.
Some examples of the order of generalized rate equations for simple reactions are given
in Table 4.2.

 CHEMISTRY GRADE 11
228
a What is the order of the reaction with respect to each substance in the rate
equation?
b What happens to the rate of reaction as [SO3] increases?
Solution:
a The reaction is first-order with respect to SO2, and is negative one-half order
with respect to SO3.
b As the concentration of SO3 increases, the rate of reaction decreases.
To find the experimental rate equation by the method of initial rates, it is necessary to
gather concentration-time data in a series of separate experiments. Each experiment
must have a different initial concentration of one or more reactants. The experiments
must be performed at the same temperature. The initial rate for each experiment can be
found from the concentration-versus-time curve.
Suppose a reaction of the type,
A → products
is under study. The data are inspected to find how the initial rate varies with the initial
concentration of A, [A]o. The objective is to find the value of the exponent in the rate
equation, rate = k [A]m, where m is the order of the reaction. For a first-order reaction,
m = 1, and the rate varies directly with [A]o. If [A]o is doubled, the rate is doubled;
if [A]o is tripled, the rate is tripled; and so on (see Table 4.3). For a second-order
reaction, m = 2 and the rate is increased by a factor of 22, or 4, if [A]o is doubled,
and so on. If the reaction is zero-order in A, changes in the concentration of A has no
effect on the reaction rate. The order for each of several reactants can be found by
varying one initial concentration at a time, while keeping the others constant.
Table 4.3 Change in initial rate with change in [A]o for rate = k [A]m
For a reaction of If [A]0 is doubled If [A]0 is tripled
Zero-order (m = 0) rate is unchanged rate is unchanged
First-order (m = 1) rate is doubled rate is tripled
Second-order (m = 2) rate is quadrupled (x 22) rate is 9 times greater (x 32)

Example 4.4
The kinetics of the reaction,
2NO(g) + O2(g) → 2NO2(g)

study.

a What is the order of reaction with respect to each reactant?
b What is the value of the rate constant?
Solution:
a Order of reaction with respect to each reactant can be determined as follows.
Holding the O2
 pressure constant, while doubling the NO pressure, quadrupled
the rate, indicating that the reaction is second order in NO. With constant
NO pressure, doubling the O2 pressure caused the rate to double, showing
that the reaction is first-order in O2. The rate equation for the formation of
NO2 becomes

 CHEMISTRY GRADE 11

From experimental observations, in 1889, Svante Arrhenius, observed that a mathematical
relationship connects activation energy, temperature, and the rate constant. This relationship
is known as the Arrhenius equation and is written as:
k = Ae–Ea/RT ...(4.6)
where, k is a rate constant at temperature T, A is a constant, R is an ideal-gas constant,
and Ea = activation energy.
Equation (4.6) shows the fraction of collisions in an elementary reaction in which the
particles have enough energy to react. The constant A corrects for the frequency of
collisions, the necessity for the proper orientation in effective collisions, and all factors
other than activation energy that are significant in effective collisions.
Taking logarithms of both sides, the equation (4.6) becomes:
a 1 log log 2.303 R
E k A
T
  − = +     ...(4.7)
The above equations show that reactions with larger activation energies have smaller
values of k and are, therefore, slower. The equation also shows that, for a given value
of activation energy, as the temperature increases, the value of rate constant increases.
This indicates that the reaction is faster, because at higher temperatures more molecules
can collide effectively.
Equation (4.7) is the equation for a straight line. The value of Ea
 can be found from the
slope of a plot of log k versus 1/T, Ea
 = – 2.303 R × slope. Also, by combining the
equations for the values of k at two different temperatures T1 and T2 for the same
reaction, a relationship is obtained that allows for the calculation of Ea

Alternatively, if Ea
 and three of the four values k1, k2, T1, and T2 are known, the fourth
can be found. In using the Arrhenius equation, the energy is customarily expressed in
joules, temperature must be in kelvin, and R is 8.314 J/ (K mol).

4.3.2 Concentration-Time Equation (Integrated Rate Law)
Activity 4.7
Form a group and discuss each of the following questions.
1. How do you explain the concentration dependence of rate of reactions?
2. What is the mathematical expression for describing order of a reaction?
3. How do you distinguish between zero-order, first-order, and second-order reaction?
A rate law tells us how the rate of reaction depends on the concentration of the
reactants at a particular moment. But, often we would like to have a mathematical
relationship that shows how a reactant concentration changes over a period of time. A
rate law can be transformed into a mathematical relationship between concentration and
time using calculus. Therefore, an integrated law relates concentration to reaction time.
1. Zero Order Reaction
A zero-order reaction is a reaction whose rate of reaction does not depend on the
reactant concentration. For the general reaction
A → Product
the zero order rate law is written as the equation
r = [A]
t
∆ − ∆ ...(4.9)
Using calculus, it can be shown from equation (4.9) that
[A]t = – kt + [A]o ...(4.10)
where [A] is concentration of A at t = t; [A]o is the concentration of A is at t = 0. Now,
zero-order reactions can be written as follows:
o [A] [A] t =− + kt ... Integrated rate equation for 0th order reaction ...(4.11)
This is a linear equation with the form of y = mx + b. For a zero-order reaction, a plot
of [A] versus-time is a straight line, whose slope is – k.

Example 4.6
The decomposition of HI into hydrogen and iodine on a gold surface is zeroorder in HI. The rate constant for the reaction is 0.050 s–1. If you begin with
a 0.500 M concentration of HI, what is the concentration of HI after 5 seconds?
Solution:
Use the integrated rate
[HI] = [HI]0 – kt
The initial concentration is [A]0 = 0.500 M, and the reaction runs for 5 seconds.
[HI] = 0.500 M – 0.050 M s–1 x 5 s = 0.250 M
2. First-Order Reactions
A first-order reaction is a reaction whose rate of reaction depends on the reactant
concentration raised to the first power. In a first-order of the type
A → Product
the rate is
r = 
∆[A]
∆t ...(4.12)
r = k [A] ...(4.13)
To obtain the units of k for this rate law, we write
k = 
M/s 1/s or s
[A] M
r = = –1
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 11
234
Combining equations (4.12) and (4.13) for the rate, we get
∆[A] − ∆t
= k[A] ...(4.14)
Using calculus, it can be shown from equation (4.14) that
o
[A] ln
[A]
t = – kt ...(4.15)
where ln is the natural logarithm, and [A]o and [A] are the concentrations of A at times
t = 0 and t = t, respectively. It should be understood that t = 0 need not correspond
to the beginning of the experiment. It can be any time at which we choose to start
monitoring the change in the concentration of A,
Equation (4.15) can be rearranged as follows:
 o ln [A] ln [A] t =− + kt ...Integrated rate equation for 1st order reaction: ...(4.16)
Equation (4.16) has the form of the linear equation y = mx + b, in which m is the slope
of the line that is the graph of the equation. Thus, a plot of ln [A] versust gives a straight
line with a slope of k (or m). This graphical analysis allows us to calculate the rate
constant k. Figure 4.9 shows the characteristics of first-order reactions.

Note! The observation that plot of ln[A] versus time is a straight line confirms that the
reaction is first-order in A and first-order overall, i.e., Rate = k[A]. The slope is equal
to –k.
In the following example, we apply equation (4.16) to a reaction.
Example 4.7
The conversion of cyclopropane in the gas phase is a first-order reaction with
a rate constant of 6.7 × 10–4 s at 500°C.
C3H6 → CH3 – CH = CH2
cyclopropane propene
a If the initial concentration of cyclopropane is 0.25 M, what is the concentration
after 8.8 minutes?
b How long does it take for the concentration of cyclopropane to decrease
from 0.25 M to 0.15 M?
c How long does it take to convert 74 % of the starting material?
Solution :
a Applying equation (4.16),
o [A] ln
[A] = kt
Solving the equation, we obtain
0.25M ln
[A] = 0.354
0.25M
[A] = e0.354 = 1.42
[A] = 0.18 M
b Again using equation (4.16), we have
0.25 M ln
0.15 M = (6.7×10–4s–) t
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 11
236
t = 7.6×102 s
= 13 minutes
c In a calculation of this type, we do not need to know the actual concentration of
the starting material. If 74% of the starting material has reacted, the amount left
after time t is (100% – 74%), or 26%. Thus, [A] /[A]o = 26/100 = 0.26. From
equation (13.3), we write
t = o 1 [A] ln
k [A]
= 4 –1
1 1.0 M ln
6.7×10 s − 0.26 M
= 2.0 × 103 s

3. Second-Order Reactions
A second order reaction is a reaction whose rate depends either on the concentration
of one reactant raised to the second power or on the concentrations of two different
reactants, each raised to the first power. The simpler type of reaction involves one kind

where
r = 
[A]

4.3.3 The Half-life of a Reaction
Form a group and do as directed:
1. Plot a graph that shows the time dependence of concentration of reactant for the
1st order reaction.
2. On the graph show the time when the concentration of a reactant is decreased by
half of its initial amount. What do you call this situation?
Discuss the results and share your ideas with the rest of the class.
The half life of a reaction is defined as the time required for the concentration of a
reactant to decrease to half of its initial concentration. This means that half-life is the time
it takes for the concentration of A to fall from [A]o to ½[A]o, i.e [A] = ½[A]o. The
half-life of a reaction is designated by the symbol, t
½.

From the relation, it can be noted that, for a first-order reaction, the half-life is independent
of the initial concentration of A, [A]o.
For second-order reactions, half-life depends on the initial concentration, [A]o, and the
rate constant, k. For a second-order reaction, the half-life expression is given by the

Taking the inverse of the natural logarithms of both sides gives the concentration
of N2O5 remaining after 1.0 hour,
[N2O5] = 0.1996 mol/L ≅ 0.20 mol/L.

4.4 REACTION MECHANISM
At the end of this section, you should be able to:
• explain reaction mechanism;
• explain the molecularity of a reaction;
• explain what is meant by rate determining step;
• give specific examples to illustrate rate determining step;
• explain the relationship between the reaction path way and the rate law; and
• use rate equation to suggest possible reaction mechanism for a reaction.
An overall balanced chemical equation does not give any information about how a
reaction actually takes place. In many cases, it merely represents the sum of several
elementary steps, or elementary reactions, a series of simple reactions that represents
the progress of the overall reaction at the molecular level. The term for the sequence
of elementary steps that leads to product formation is reaction mechanism. The reaction
mechanism is comparable to the simplest description you might give of the route of a
trip you plan to take. The overall chemical equation specifies only the origin and destination,
while the reaction mectanim describes the stopovers also.
As an example of a reaction mechanism, let us consider the reaction between nitric
oxide and oxygen:
2NO(g) + O2(g) → 2NO2(g)
We know that the products are not formed directly from the collision of two NO
molecules with an O2 molecule, because N2O2 is detected during the course of the
reaction. Let us assume that the reaction actually takes place via two elementary steps
as follows:
2NO(g) → N2O2(g)
N2O2(g) + O2(g) → 2NO2(g)
In the first elementary step, two NO molecules collide to form a N2O2 molecule. This
event is followed by the reaction between N2
O2
 and O2
 to give two molecules of NO2
.
The net chemical equation, which represents the overall change, is given by the sum of
the elementary steps:
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 11
242
Form a group and try to identify the number of molecular species involved in each of the
following reactions:
1. A → products
2. A + A → products
3. A + B → products
4. A + A + B → products
5. A + B + C → products.
Share your findings with the rest of the class.
The minimum number of reacting particles (molecules, atoms or ions) that come
together or collide in a rate determining step to form product or products is called the
molecularity of a reaction. It is the number of reactant molecules taking part in a single
step of the reaction.
Example 4.10
a PCl5 → PCl3 + Cl2 (Unimolecular)
b 2HI → H2 + I2 (Bimolecular)
c 2SO2 + O2 → 2SO3 (Termolecular)
d NO + O3 → NO2 + O2 (Bimolecular)
e 2CO + O2 → 2CO2 (Termolecular)
f 2FeCl3 + SnCl2 → SnCl2 + 2FeCl2 (Termolecular)
In the reaction that involve sequence of steps rate is determined by the flowest
step.
Activity 4.9
Elementary step: NO + NO → N2O2
Elementary step: N2O2 + O2 → 2NO2
Overall reaction 2NO + O2 → 2NO2
Species such as N2O2 are called intermediates because they appear in the mechanism
of the reaction (that is, the elementary steps) but not in the overall balanced equation.
4.4.1 Molecularity of an Elementary Reaction
CHEMICAL KINETICS
243
Activity 4.10
Example 4.11
Decomposition of H2O2 takes place in the following two steps:
Step 1: H2O2 → H2O + [O] (Slow)
Step 2: [O] + [O] → O2 (fast)
H2O2 → H2O + 1/2O2 (overall reaction)
The slowest step is rate-determining. Thus, from step 1, reaction appears to be
unimolecular.
It may be noted that molecularity is a theoretical concept and it cannot be zero,
negative, fractional, infinite and imaginary.
Exercise 4.9
1. Give the meanings of each of the following terms:
a Elementary steps
b Unimolecular reaction
c Bimolecular reaction
d Termolecular reaction
2. Determine the molecularity of the following reactions:
a NH4NO2 —→ N2 + 2H2O
b O3 + NO —→ NO2 + O2
c 2NO + O2 —→ 2NO2
4.4.2 Rate-Determining Step
Form a group and discuss each of the following questions. After the discussion, share your
ideas with the rest of the class.
1. What do you think a rate determining step is?
2. Why do chemists want to know the rate determining step?
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 11
244
The experimentally determined rate law is: Rate = k[NO2
][F2
], the proposed reaction
mechanism is:
NO2 + F2 k
1
→ NO2F + •F slow
NO2 + •F k
2→ NO2F fast
Let us check whether the proposed mechanism agrees with the experimental rate law
or not. First, the sum of these reaction steps must give the overall balanced equation:
NO2 + F2 → NO2F + •F
NO2 + •F → NO2F
Overall equation: 2NO2 + F2 → 2NO2F
So, the first requirement is satisfied. The formation of •F in the first step occurs more
slowly than its reaction with NO2 to form NO2F in the second step. Thus, the rate of
formation of NO2F in the second step is controlled by the rate of formation of •F in the
first step. The overall rate cannot be faster than that of the slowest step.
Overall rate = the rate of the slowest step
The rate law agrees with experimentally determined rate law. So, the proposed mechanism
is acceptable because it satisfies both requirements.
In a multi-step reaction, all the elementary reactions do not necessarily proceed at equal
rates. One of them might be very rapid, moderate or very slow. The reactants can be
converted to products only as fast as they can complete the slowest step. The slowest
step in the sequence of steps leading to the formation of products is called the ratedetermining step. In other words, the slowest step in the mechanism determines the
overall rate of the reaction.
Because the rate-determining step limits the rate of the overall reaction, its rate law
represents the rate law for the overall reaction. For example, the reaction of NO2 with
F2
 is given by the equation:
2NO2(g) + F2(g) → 2NO2F(g)
CHEMICAL KINETICS
245
Exercise 4.10
Answer each of the following questions.
1. Describe the term molecularity of a reaction.
2. How do you identify the rate determining step for a reaction that involves
more than one step?
 3. The reaction
NO2(g) + CO(g) → NO(g) + CO2(g)
can be thought of as occurring in two elementary steps:
a NO2 + NO2 → NO + NO3 (slow step)
b NO3 + CO → NO2 + CO2 (fast step)
 Identify the rate determining step and determine the molecularity of this reaction.
Unit Summary
• Chemical kinetics is the study of the rates and mechanisms of chemical
reactions.
• A chemical reaction occurs when atoms, molecules or ions undergo effective
collisions.
• The larger the activation energy, the slower a chemical reaction and vice
versa.
• In general, reaction rates increase with temperature, because higher
temperature increases both the frequency of collisions and the number of
molecules possessing enough energy to undergo effective collision.
• A chemical equation represents an elementary reaction only if the reaction
in the equation represents the actual atoms, molecules or ions that must
interact for the reaction to occur.
• Elementary reactions that are bimolecular (the most common) have two
 CHEMISTRY GRADE 11
246
reactant species, while unimolecular reactions have only one and termolecular
reactions have three.
• Reaction rate is expressed as the change in concentration of a reactant or
product, per unit time.
• Both reaction rates and rate equations must be determined experimentally,
often by gathering data on the variation of concentration over time.
• Rate equations often take the form of
Rate= k[A]m[B]n[C]p
where the sum of m, n, p, is the overall reaction order. The order of a
specific reactant is given by m, or n, or p, and the exponents in a rate
equation are often 1,2 or 3, but may also be fractions or negative numbers.
• Rates of first-order and second-order reactions are dependent upon the
concentrations of one or two reactants, respectively. In contrast, rates of
zero-order reactions are independent of reactant concentrations.
• The half-life of a first order reaction is independent of the initial reactant
concentration, whereas half-life of second order reaction depends on the
initial reactant concentration.
• Reaction rates are influenced by the concentrations of reactants, temperature,
catalysts and the degree of contact between reactants (surface area).
• Reaction rates and rate constants vary with temperature.
• The Arrhenius equation gives the relationships among the temperature,
the rate constant and the activation energy for a given reaction, either for
an elementary reaction or an overall reaction.
• In a heterogeneous reaction, the reactants are in different phases and the
rates of such reactions are limited by the amount of the contact between
reactants.
• Catalysts increase the rates of chemical reactions but can be recovered
unchanged at the end of a reaction
