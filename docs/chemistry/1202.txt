Acids and bases are important in numerous chemical processes that occur around us.
Their importance vary greatly, for example, from industrial processes to biological ones
and from reactions in the laboratory to those in our environment. Proteins, enzymes, food
products, medicines, blood, genetic material, and other components of living matter contain
both acids and bases.
In this unit you will learn three definitions of acids and bases that will allow you to understand
ever-increasing numbers of reactions in different phases of life. While dealing with the
acids and the basis, you will also be able to apply the principles of chemical equilibrium to
this essential group of substances.
After presenting the classical (Arrhenius) acid-base definition, we will examine the acid
dissociation to see why acids vary in strength. The pH scale is introduced as a means of
comparing the acidity or basicity of aqueous solutions. Then, we will notice that the short
coming of the Arrhenius theory are overcome by the theory proposed independently by
J.N. Brønsted in Denmark and T.M. Lowry in Great Britian.

Weak acids and weak bases are important weak electrolytes. They are found in many
chemical and biological processes of interest. Amino acids, for example, are both weak
acids and weak bases. In this unit, we will learn some ways of expressing concentrations
of hydronium ions and of hydroxide ions in solutions of weak acids and weak bases. Then
you will examine equilibria involving these weak electrolytes. You will also see that the
indicators, used in titration, such as phenolphthalein, are weak acids or weak bases. Finally
you will learn how to use these properties to select an appropriate indicator for a titration.

2.1.1 The Arrhenius Concept of Acids and Bases
Svante August Arrhenius (1859-1927), was a Swedish chemist
helped lay the foundations of modern chemistry. Born near
Uppsala, Sweden, he was educated at the University of Uppsala
and received his Ph.D. in 1884. While still a student, he studied
the conductive properties of electrolytic (charge-conducting)
solutions. In his doctoral thesis, he formulated the theory of
electrolytic dissociation.
This theory holds that, in electrolytic solutions, the dissolved
chemical compounds in the solution are dissociated into ions,
even when there is no current flowing through the solution.
Arrhenius also postulated that the degree of dissociation
increases as the solution becomes more dilute. This hypothesis
later turned out to be significantly true only for weak
electrolytes. His theory was initially thought to be completely
wrong, and his thesis was given the lowest possible passing
grade. Later, however, Arrhenius’ theory of electrolytic
dissociation became generally accepted, and eventually became
one of the cornerstones of modern physical chemistry and
electrochemistry.

Activity 2.2
Form groups and discuss the following questions and write a report of your discussion.
1. Explain Arrhenius acids and bases concepts using suitable examples?
2. Does hydrogen ion exist freely in water?
What are the drawbacks of the Arrhenius’ concepts of acids and bases?
The Arrhenius definition of acids and bases has the following limitations.
* It defines acids and bases in terms of what happens when compounds dissolve in
water. However, similar chemistry occurs in many reactions that take place in solvents
other than water, and this definition does not work for such reactions.
* It does not explain why some compounds in which hydrogen has an oxidation
number of + 1 (such as HCl) dissolve in water to give acidic solutions, whereas
others (such as NH3) do so.
ACID-BASE EQUILIBRIA (UNIT 2)
71
* Only the compounds that contain the OH–
 ion can be classified as Arrhenius bases.
The Arrhenius definition does not explain why compounds such as Na2CO3 have
basic properties.
Exercise 2.1
Based on their dissociations in water solution, classify each of the following
compounds as Arrhenius acid, Arrhenius base, or as a compound that cannot be

2.1.2 Brønsted-Lowry Concept of Acids and Bases
Activity 2.3
From what you have learnt in Grade 10 Chemistry discuss the following questions.
1. What are acids and bases according to Brønsted-Lowry concept?
2. How does it differ from Arrhenius definition? What are the similarities?
3. Give two Brønsted-Lowry bases that are not Arrhenius bases.
4. Are there any Brønsted acids that do not behave as Arrhenius acids?
Consider the ionization of hydrochloric acid in water:
Which one is a Brønsted-Lowry acid and which one is a Brønsted-Lowry base?
The Brønsted-Lowry concept is not limited to reactions in aqueous solution. For example,
HCl is an acid in liquid ammonia, NH3(l), just as it is in water.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
72
The Brønsted-Lowry concept successfully explains how ammonia acts as a base in water,
which the Arrhenius definition fails to do. In the ionization of ammonia, NH3, water is the
acid. The ionization of ammonia in water is a reversible reaction. This reversible acid-base
reaction can be written as:
Once an acid has given up a proton, the remaining part can be a proton acceptor and is,
now called a conjugate base. On the other hand, when a base accepts a proton, the
species formed is called conjugate acid.
Every acid has a conjugate base, and every base has a conjugate acid. Thus, for any
conjugate acid-base pair:
• The conjugate base has one less H and one more minus charge than the acid.
• The conjugate acid has one more H and one less minus charge than the base.

Solution:
To identify Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases, we look for the proton donors
and proton-acceptors in each reaction.
a H2S is converted to HS– by donating a proton. So, H2S is an acid, and
HS- is its conjugate base. NH3 accepts the proton lost by the H2S. As a
result, NH3 is a base, and NH4
+ is its conjugate acid.

Strengths of Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs
The stronger the acid, the weaker is its conjugate base. Similarly, the stronger the base,
the weaker is its conjugate acid. For example, HCl is a strong acid, and its conjugate
base Cl–, is a weak base. Acetic acid, CH3COOH, is a weak acid, and its conjugate
base, CH3COO–,is a strong base. The following chart shows the strength of conjugate
acid-base pairs .

Auto-ionisation of Substances
Name the ions present in water. How are they formed?
The auto-ionisation (self-ionization) of a substance involves the transfer of a proton from
one molecule of the substance to another molecule of the same substance. For example,

Note that, in this reaction, some water molecules behave as acids, donating protons, while
the other water molecules behave as bases, accepting protons.
Amphiprotic Species
Many molecules and ions gain or lose a proton, under appropriate conditions. Such species
are said to be amphiprotic. For example,
HCO3
–(aq) U H+(aq) + CO3
2–(aq)
HCO3
–(aq) + H+(aq) U H2CO3(aq)
In other words, amphiprotic species are species that can act as both an acid and a base.

2.1.3 Lewis Concept of Acids and Bases
Activity 2.4

teacher.
1. Explain Lewis concept of acids and bases.
2. How do Lewis acids and bases differ from Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases?
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
76
3. Are all Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases are also acids and bases according to Lewis
concept?
4. Is there any limitation to the Brønsted-Lowry definition of acids and bases? Explain if any.
The Lewis acid-base concept includes many reactions that do not involve proton- transfer
reactions. Consider, for example, the reaction between boron trifluoride (BF3
) and ammonia
to form a compound, BF3 ¨ :NH3.
N + B H—N B—F
H
H H
F
F F H
H F
F
Lewis base Lewis acid
The boron atom in boron trifluoride, BF3, has only six electrons in its valance shell and
needs two electrons to satisfy the octet rule. Consequently, BF3 (Lewis acid) accepts a
pair of electrons from NH3 (Lewis base).
This example suggests that in a Lewis acid-base reaction, we should look for:
1. a species that has an available empty orbital to accommodate an electron pair such
as the B atom in BF3, and
2. a species that has lone-pair electrons such as NH3.
The Lewis definition allows us to consider typical Brønsted-Lowry bases, such as OH–,
NH3, and H2O, as Lewis bases. They all have electron pairs available to donate for
electron-deficient species.
Note that any molecule or negatively charged species having an excess of electrons can be
considered as a Lewis base, and any electron-deficient molecule or positively charged
species can be considered as a Lewis acid.

2.2 IONIC EQUILIBRIA OF WEAK ACIDS AND BASES
At the end of this subunit, you will be able to:
• describe the ionization of water;
• derive the expression of ion product for water, Kw;
• explain the effect of temperature on Kw;
• explain why water is a weak electrolyte;
• use Kw to calculate [H3O+] or [OH–

 and the initial

initial concentration of the solution.
2.2.1 Ionization of Water
How do you calculate the concentration of H3O+ ions if the concentrations of
OH– ions and Kw, at 25°C are given?
Recall that water is amphiprotic. So, to a slight extent, water molecules can transfer protons
among themselves. In the self-ionization of water, the proton lost by one water molecule is
gained by the other.

The self-ionization of water can be represented by the following equation:

K where, Kc
 is the equilibrium constant, in terms of concentration.
Because only very small fractions of water molecules are ionized, the concentration of
water, [H2
O], remains unchanged. This equilibrium expression can be simplified by including
the constant [H2
O]2 term with the value of Kc
 to obtain a new equilibrium constant, the
ion-product for water, Kw.
Kc
 [H2O]2 = KW = [H3O+] [OH–]
Note that Kw is the product of the molar concentrations of H3O+ and OH– ions at a
particular temperature.
Since we use H+(aq) and H3
O+(aq) interchangeably to represent the hydrated proton, the
equilibrium constant can also be expressed as
Kw = [H+][OH–]
In pure water at 25°C, the concentrations of H+ and OH– ions are equal and found to be
[H+] = 1.0 × 10–7 M and [OH–] = 1.0 × 10–7 M at 25°C,
Kw = [H+][OH–] = (1.0 × 10–7) (1.0 ×10–7) = 1.0 × 10–14
As you have learned in your studies of chemical equilibrium in Grade 11, the value of Kc
,
in this case Kw, changes as temperature changes. In any aqueous solution at 25°C, no
matter what it contains, the product of [H+] and [OH–] must always equal 1.0 × 10–14.
There are three possible situations.
a A neutral solution, where [H+] = [OH–].
b An acidic solution, where [H+] > [OH–].
c A basic solution, where [OH–] > [H+]

5. Why water is a weak electrolyte?
The pH scale
The concentration of H+ in aqueous solution is usually very small and inconvenient to
express and to draw as graphs. Sören Sörensen, in 1909, developed the pH scale to
solve this problem. The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen
ion concentration (in mol/L):
pH = –log [H3O+] or pH = –log [H+]
Activity 2.5

Note that the negative logarithm gives us positive numbers for pH. What is the pH value

pH decreases as the concentration of H+ ions increases; in other words, the more acidic
the solution, the lower its pH; the more basic the solution, the higher its pH.
The pH notation has been extended to other exponential quantities. For example, hydroxide
concentrations can be expressed in terms of pOH, where pOH = –log [OH–]. Similarly,
pKw can be expressed as –log Kw .

2.2.2 Measures of the Strengths of Acids and Bases in
Aqueous Solution
The strength of acids and bases can be described in many ways. Some of the ways are
the concentration of hydrogen and hydroxide ions, pH and pOH, percent dissociation,
Ka
 and Kb
.
1. Concentration of hydrogen and hydroxide ions
Acid strength refers to the ability of an acid to release protons. A strong acid gives up
protons more easily than a weak acid. For two acids of equal concentrations, the strongest
acid produces the greater quantity of hydrogen ions. Base strength refers to the ability of a
base to accept protons. A strong base accepts more protons readily than a weak base. A
solution of a stronger base will contain a larger concentration of hydroxide ions than a
solution of a weaker base if both solutions are of equal concentration.
Activity 2.8
In unit two of Grade 10 Chemistry, you learned about the strength of acids and bases.
By referring to this text book and other chemistry books, list strong acids, strong bases,
weak acids and weak bases. Then discuss what you have written with the rest of the class.
ACID-BASE EQUILIBRIA (UNIT 2)
83
2. pH and pOH
If the pOH of a solution at 25°C is 12, is it acidic, neutral or basic?
It is possible to predict the strength of acids from their pH values. The smaller the pH
value, the stronger the acid. The concentration of hydroxide ions in a solution can be
expressed in terms of the pOH of the solution. Hence, the strength of bases can also be
determined from their pOH values. The smaller the pOH value, the stronger the base.
3. Percent Ionization
How do you determine the percent ionization of an acid or a base?
The extent to which an acid or base ionizes is called percent ionization. Mathematically,
Percent ionization = Ionized acid or base concentration at equilibrium × 100
Initial concentration of ionized acid or base
The strength of an acid depends on the percentage of the acid molecules that dissociate in
water solution. If a higher percentage of the original acid molecules dissociate, then the
acid is a strong acid. Strong acids and strong bases ionize nearly completely in water.
However, weak acids and weak bases dissociate partially in water, and their percent of
ionization is small.
4. Dissociation (Ionization) Constants
Acid Dissociation Constant, Ka
What is the relationship between strength of acids with their acid-dissociation
constant values?
The acid-dissociation constant is a quantitative measure of the strength of the acid in a
given solvent. For the dissociation of the acid, HA;
HA(aq) + H2O(l) U H3O+(aq) + A–(aq)
the dissociation-constant expression can be written as:
[ ]

CHEMISTRY GRADE 12

The product of the two constants, K and [H2

which is the acid-dissociation constant or the acid-ionization constant. Hence for a weak
acid, HA:
[ ]

HO A

K
     
The Ka
 value for a strong acid is very large, because [HA] in the denominator is very small
since the acid dissociates essentially completely. Similarly, the Ka
 value for a weak acid is
relatively small, since [H3
O+] and [A–] are very small, and [HA] in the denominator is large.
The ionization-constants of some weak monoprotic acids are tabulated in Table 2.2.
Table 2.2 Ionization constant of some weak monoprotic acids at 25°C.
Name of the Acid Formula Ka
Acetic acid CH3COOH 1.8 × 10–5
Ascorbic acid C6H8O6 8.0 × 10–5
Benzoic Acid C6H5COOH 6.5 × 10–5
Formic acid HCOOH 1.7 × 10–4

Hypobromous acid HOBr 2.5 × 10–9
Hypochlorous acid HOCl 3.0 × 10–8
Nitrous acid HNO2 4.5 × 10–4
How do you calculate the pH of weak acids?
Generally, we can calculate the hydrogen-ion concentration or pH of an acid solution at
equilibrium, given the initial concentration of the acid and its Ka
 value. Alternatively, if we
know the pH of a weak acid solution and its initial concentration, we can determine its Ka
.
The following may help you to solve weak-acid dissociation problems.

7. first solve for x by the approximation method. If the approximation is not valid, use
the quadratic equation.
8. having solved for x, calculate the equilibrium concentrations of all species and/or the
pH of the solution.
Example 2.4
Calculate the pHof a 0.50 M HF solution at 25°C. The ionization of HF is given by
HF(aq) + H2O(l) U H3O+(aq) + F–(aq)
Solution:
The species that can affect the pH of the solution are HF, and the conjugate base F–,
Let x be the equilibrium concentration of H3
O+ and F-
 ions in molarity (M). Thus,

Rearranging this expression provides:
x2 + 6.8 × 10–4 x – 3.4 × 10–4 = 0
This is a quadratic equation that can be solved, using the quadratic formula, or you
can use the approximation method for x. Because HF is a weak acid, and weak
acids ionize only to a slight extent, x must be small compared to 0.50. Therefore,
you can make this approximation:
0.50 – x ª 0.50
Now, the ionization constant expression becomes

Rearranging this equation gives:
x2 = (0.5)(6.8 × 10–4) = 3.4 × 10–4
x = 
–4 3.4×10 = 1.8 × 10–2 M
Thus, we have solved for x without using the quadratic equation. At equilibrium, we have
[HF] = (0.50 – 0.018) M = 0.48 M
[H3O+] = 0.018 M
[F–] = 0.018 M
and the pH of the solution is
pH = –log(0.018) = 1.74
How good is this approximation? Because Ka
 values for weak acids are generally
known to an accuracy of only ±5%, it is reasonable to require x to be less than 5%
of 0.50, the number from which it is subtracted. In other words, the approximation
is valid if the percent ionization is equal to or less than 5%.
0.018 ×100% = 3.6%
0.50 Is the approximation valid?

In solving problems involving weak bases, you should follow the same guidelines as you
followed for weak acids. The main difference is that we calculate [OH–

2.3.1 The Common ion Effect
Activity 2.9
In Grade 11 Chemistry, you learned Le Chatelier’s principle. Make a group and discuss the
following and present your report to the class.
Industrially, ammonia is produced by the Haber process.
1. Write a chemical equation for the production of ammonia in the process.
2. Assume that the reaction is at equilibrium. What is the effect of
a adding more ammonia to the equilibrium system?
b removing ammonia from the equilibrium system?
c adding more hydrogen gas to the equilibrium system?
d decreasing the concentration of both hydrogen and nitrogen gases from the
equilibrium system?
e increasing temperature?
f decreasing pressure?
g adding finely divided iron as a catalyst?
The common-ion effect is caused by the addition of a compound having an ion in common
with the dissolved substance that shift the equilibrium.
The presence of the common ion suppresses the ionization of a weak acid or a weak base.
For example, if sodium acetate and acetic acid are dissolved in the same solution, they
both dissociate and ionize to produce CH3COO– ions.
CH3COONa (s) Æ CH3COO– (aq) + Na+ (aq)
CH3COOH (aq) + H2O (l) U CH3COO– (aq) + H3O+ (aq)
Sodium acetate, CH3COONa, is a strong electrolyte, so it dissociates completely in
solution, but acetic acid, CH3COOH, is a weak acid and ionizes partially. According to
Le Chatelier’s principle, the addition of CH3COO– ions from CH3COONa to a solution
of CH3COOH will suppress the ionization of CH3COOH and decrease the concentration
of hydrogen ions.
Therefore, a solution containing both CH3COOH and CH3COONa will be less acidic
than a solution containing only CH3COOH of the same concentration. The shift in equilibrium
of the acetic acid ionization is caused by the acetate ions from the sodium acetate. CH3
COO–
is the common ion because it is supplied by both CH3COOH and CH3COONa.

2.3.2 Buffer Solutions
How does a buffer solution resist a pH change?
A buffer solution is a solution that resists changes in pH from the addition of a limited
amount of an acid or a base. Table 2.4 shows how the pH of unbuffered and buffered
solutions change when a small amount of acid or base is added.
Table 2.4 Comparison of buffered and unbuffered solutions.
Initial pH of pH after addition of pH after addition of
1.0 L sample 0.010 mol NaOH 0.010 mol HCl
Unbuffered solution: 4.8 12.0 2.0
1.28 × 10–5 M HCl
Buffered solution: 4.8 4.8 4.7
0.099 M CH3COOH
0.097 M CH3COONa
Buffers contain either a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its
conjugate acid.
A buffer solution must contain a relatively large concentration of acid to react with any
OH– ions that are added to it. Similarly, it must contain a relatively large concentration of
base to react with any H+ ions. To understand the action of buffer, consider a buffer that
contains approximately equal molar amounts of a weak acid, HA, and its conjugate base,
A–
. When a strong acid is added to the buffer, it supplies hydrogen ions that react with the
base A–.
H+ (aq) + A– (aq) Æ HA (aq)
On the other hand, when a strong base is added to the buffer, it supplies hydroxide ions
that react with the acid, HA.
OH– (aq) + HA (aq) Æ H2O (l) + A– (aq)
Thus, a buffer solution resists changes in pHthrough its ability to combine with the H+ and
OH– ions.
Buffers are very important to chemical and biological systems. The pH in the human body
varies greatly from one fluid to another. For example; the pH of blood is about 7.4, whereas
the gastric juice in our stomach has a pH of about 1.5. The pH values, which are crucial for
proper enzyme function and the balance of osmotic pressure, are maintained by buffers in
most cases.

human blood. Discuss the report with the rest of the class.

HCl to 1.0 L of the solution? Assume that the volume of the solution does not
change when HCl is added.
Solution:
1. In this case, you are asked to calculate the pH of the buffer system of CH3COOH/
CH3COONa before adding HCl. Hence, you can apply the same method you
have used to calculate a solution containing common ions:

2.4 HYDROLYSIS OF SALTS
At the end of this subunit, you will be able to:
• define hydrolysis;
• explain why a salt of weak acid and strong base gives a basic solution;
• explain why a salt of strong acid and weak base gives an acidic solution; and
• explain why salts of weak acids and weak bases give acidic, basic or neutral
solutions.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
94
What does salt hydrolysis mean?
The word “hydrolysis’ is derived from the Greek words hydro, meaning “water”, and
lyses, meaning “to split apart”. Solutions of salts contain two types of ions, namely cations
and anions. The term salt hydrolysis describes the reaction of an anion or a cation of a salt,
or both, with water. Depending on the strengths of the parent acids and bases, the cation
of a salt can serve as an acid, base or neutral.
2.4.1 Hydrolysis of Salts of Strong Acids and Strong Bases
The anions derived from strong acids are weak conjugate bases and do not undergo hydrolysis.
The strong bases are the ionic hydroxides of Group IA and IIA metals. The cations of these
metals also do not hydrolyze. For example, sodium chloride, NaCl, is a salt of a strong acid,
HCl, and a strong base, NaOH. Since chloride ions, Cl–, and sodium ions, Na+, do not
hydrolyze, the solution of the salt will be neutral. Can you give more examples?
2.4.2 Hydrolysis of Salts of Weak Acids and Strong Bases
Solutions of these salts are basic because the anion of the weak acid is a moderately strong
base and can be hydrolyzed as follows.
X– + H2O Æ HX + OH–
Activity 2.11

 and discuss the following :
a What are the ‘parents’ (acid and base) of this salt?
b Which ions of the salt can be hydrolyzed?
c What will be the nature of Na2

2.4.3 Hydrolysis of Salts of Strong Acids and Weak Bases
A cation (the conjugate acid of a weak base) hydrolyzes as an acid. As in the first case,
anions of a strong acid are weak conjugate bases and do not hydrolyze.
Consider the hydrolysis of NH4Cl. Ammonium ion, NH4
+, is acidic and reacts with water
to produce ammonia and hydronium ions.

ACID-BASE EQUILIBRIA (UNIT 2)

What will be the pH of the solution of this salt? Is it acidic, basic or neutral?
2.4.4 Hydrolysis of Salts of Weak Acids and Weak Bases
The solution of these salts contain both a strong acid (the cation of the weak base) and a
strong base (the anion of the weak acid). Whether the solution of such a salt is acidic, basic
or neutral depends on the relative strengths of the acidic cation and the basic anion. If the
acid is stronger than the base, the solution is acidic and if the base is stronger than the acid,
the solution is basic. If they are of equal strengths, the solution is neutral.
How do you determine the strength of the acid and the base?
Activity 2.12
In the following table you are given Ka
 and Kb values of some cations and anions,
respectively.

2.5.1 Acid–Base Indicators
How do acid-base indicators change colour?
Acid-base indicators are weak organic acids or weak organic bases that indicate whether
a solution is acidic, basic or neutral.
Let us consider a weak organic acid that is denoted by HIn. In order to be effective
indicators, HIn, and its conjugate base, In–, must have different colours. In solution, the
acid ionizes as follows:
HIn(aq) + H2O(l) U H3O+(aq) + In–(aq)
If the indicator is in sufficiently acidic medium, the equilibrium, according to Le Chatelier’s
principle, shifts to the left and the predominant colour of the indicator is that of nonionized
form (HIn). On the other hand, in a basic medium, the equilibrium shifts to the right and the
colour of the solution will be that of the ionized form (In–).
Since the indicator molecule is a weak acid, the ratio of HIn and In– is governed by the
[H3O+] of the test solution.

To illustrate how an indicator works, consider an indicator that has a yellow colour in acid

Indicators are used in the laboratory for estimating the pH of a solution and to reveal the
equivalence point of a titration. Equivalence point is the point at which stoichiometrically
equivalent quantities of an acid and a base have been brought together.
Some common indicators and their colors in acids and in bases are shown in Table 2.5.

2. How does the equivalent mass of an acid and a base obtained?
3. What is the difference between normality and molarity? Discuss this in terms of acidbase reaction and in terms of oxidation-reduction reactions.
According to the definition of normality, the number of equivalents is the normality multiplied
by the volume of solution, in litres. If we add enough acid to neutralize a given volume of
base, the following equation holds:
N1V1 = N2V2

Procedure:
1. Clean the burette with distilled water and rinse it with the 0.1 N sodium hydroxide
solution; and fix the burette on the burette clamp in vertical position (Figure 2.3).
2. Using a funnel, introduce 0.1 N sodium hydroxide solution into the burette. Allow
some of the solution to flow out and make sure that there are no air bubbles in the
solution (why?). Record level of the solution, corresponding to the bottom of the
meniscus, to the nearest 0.1 mL. Measure exactly 10 mL of hydrochloric acid
solution (given) with the help of a10 mL pipette and add it into a clean 150 mL
Erlenmeyer flask and add two or three drops of phenolphthalein indicator.
Caution: When you suck hydrochloric acid or any reagent solution, into a pipette,
have the maximum caution not to suck it into your mouth.
Titration: First hold the neck of the Erlenmeyer flask with one hand and the stopcock with the other. As you add the sodium hydroxide solution from the burette,
swirl the content of the flask gently and continuously. Add sodium hydroxide
solution until the first faint pink colour comes which disappears on swirling. Add
more sodium hydroxide drop wise until the pink colour persists for a few seconds.
Find the difference between the initial level and the end point level of the burette.
Observations and analysis:
1. Colour change at the end point is from __________ to _________.
2. What is the volume of sodium hydroxide added at the end point?
3. What is the normality of hydrochloric acid at the end point?
4. What is the similarity and difference between equivalence point and end point
level after reaching the end point.

A titration is a technique in which a solution of known concentration is used to determine the
concentration of an unknown solution. Typically, the titrant (the known solution) is added
from a burette to a known quantity of the analyte (the unknown solution) until the neutralization
reaction is complete. The point at which the acid has completely reacted with or been
neutralized by the base, or vice versa, is called the equivalence point of the titration.
Knowing the volume of titrant added allows the determination of the concentration of the
unknown. Often, an indicator is used to signal the end of the reaction, the end point. The
end point of titration is the pH at which the indicator changes colour. A graph of pH as a
function of the added titrant is called a titration curve. Figure 2.4 shows the technique of
titration.

Figure 2.4 The Techinques of Titration.
a A precisely measured volume HCl(aq) is discharged from a pipette into a quantity
of water in small flask. Then a few drops of phenolphthalein indicator solution are
added. The solution is colourless. What does this indicate?
b NaOH(aq) is slowly added from a burette into the flask. Until all of the HCl has
been neutralized, the HCl is in excess and the NaOH is the limiting reactant. The
solution remains colourless, indicating that it is still acidic.
c At the point when the acid has just been completely neutralized, which is the
equivalence point, HCl and NaOH are in stoichiometric proportions. An additional
drop of NaOH(aq) beyond this point makes the solution slightly basic, and the
indicator turns to a light pink colour. The titration is stopped, and the volume of
solution delivered from the burette is recorded.
To perform a successful titration, we must use an indicator that changes color at the
equivalence point.

Strong Acid-Strong Base Titrations
What is the pH of a solution of strong acid-strong base titration at the equivalence
point? What are the indicators used in this type of titration?
Take 20 mL of 0.5 M HCl (a strong acid), in a small flask and slowly add 0.5 M NaOH (a
strong base) to it. To establish data for a titration curve, we can calculate the pH of the
accumulated solution at different points in the titration. Then we can plot these pH values
versus the volume of NaOH(aq) added. From the titration curve, we can establish the pH
at the equivalence point and identify appropriate indicators for the titration. The pH at
different points in the titration of 20 mL of 0.5 M HCl with 0.5 M NaOH can be calculated
as follows:
a Before the addition of any NaOH
Because HCl is a strong acid, it ionizes completely. Therefore, the initial solution has
[H3O+] = 0.5 M
pH = –log [H3O+] = –log (0.5) = 0.3
b After the addition of 5 mL of 0.5 M NaOH
The total number of moles of H3O+ to be titrated is:
0.02 L × 0.5 mol/L = 0.0l mol
The number of moles of OH– in 5 mL of 0.5 M NaOH is:
0.005 L ×0.5 mol/L = 0.0025 mol
Since 0.0025 moles of NaOH neutralizes 0.0025 moles of HCl, the number of
moles of H3
O+ ion unneutralized is 0.01 mol – 0.0025 mol = 0.0075 mol.
The total volume is 20 mL + 5 mL = 25 mL = 0.025 L.
Concentration of H3
O+ unneutralized is:
0.0075mol = 0.3mol/L
0.025L
pH = –log 0.3 = 0.52
c pH after the addition of 10.0 mL NaOH
The moles of H3O+ to be titrated is again 0.02 L × 0.5 M = 0.01 mol.
The moles of OH– added is 0.01 L × 0.5 M = 0.005 mol
Since 0.005 mol OH– neutralizes 0.005 mol H3O+, then the amount of H3O+ that
remains unneutralized is 0.01 mol – 0.005 mol = 0.005 mol.
ACID-BASE EQUILIBRIA (UNIT 2)
103
The total volume of the solution is 20 mL + 10 mL = 30 mL = 0.03 L.
The concentration of unneutralized H3
O+ is:
0.005mol = 0.17 M
0.030 L
pH = – log [H3O+] = –log 0.17 = 0.77
d pH after the addition of 15.0 mL NaOH
The number of mole of H3O+ here is also 0.01 mol.
The moles of OH– ion added is 0.5 M × 0.015 L = 7.5 × 10–3 mol.
7.5 × 10–3 moles OH– ions neutralizes 7.5 × 10–3 mol H3O+ ions.
Then, the amount of H3
O+ ions that remain unneutralized is:
0.01 mol – 7.5 × 10–3 mol = 2.5 × 10–3 mol
Total volume is 20 mL + 15 mL = 35 mL = 0.035 L
The concentration of H3
O+ unneutralized is:
–3 2.5×10 mol = 0.07 M
0.035L
pH = –log [H3O+] = –log 0.07 = 1.15
e pH after the addition of 20 mL NaOH
This is a simple calculation, because it involves a complete-neutralization reaction,
and the salt (NaCl) does not undergo hydrolysis. What do you call this point?
At this point, [H3O+] = [OH–] = 1.0 × 10–7
pH = –log [H3O+] = –log (1.0× 10–7) = 7
f pH after the addition of 25 mL NaOH
Do any moles of H3O+ remain unneutralized here?
The moles of OH– ions added is 0.5 M × 0.025 L = 0.0125 mol. Since all the H3O+
ions are neutralized, there is only 0.0125 mol OH–.
The total volume here is 20 mL+ 25 mL = 45 mL = 0.045 L.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
104
Concentration of OH– is:
0.0125mol = 0.28M
0.045L
pOH = –log[OH–] = –log 0.28 = 0.55
pH = 14 – 0.55 = 13.45
Can you now calculate the pH after the addition of 30 mL of 0.5 M NaOH?
Now you have the data for a titration curve.

Features of the titration curve for the titration of a strong acid with a strong base.
* The pH is low at the beginning of the titration.
* The pH change slowly until just before the equivalence point.
* Just before the equivalence point, the pH rises sharply.
* At the equivalence point, the pH is 7.00.
* Just past the equivalence point, the pH continues its sharp rise.
* Further beyond the equivalence point, the pH continues to increase, but much less
slowly.
* Any indicator whose colour changes in the pH range from about 4 to 10 can be
used in the titration of a strong acid with a strong base. Methyl violet changes colour
too soon, and alizarin yellow R too late. So, bromthymol blue and phenolphthalein
are preferred for this titration.

added to 50 mL of 0.1 M HCl solution.

Weak Acid-Strong Base Titrations
Can you predict the pH range at the equivalence point?
The titration of a weak acid by a strong base is slightly more complicated than the titration
of a strong acid by a strong base. The conjugate base of a weak acid will undergo hydrolysis,
which will affect the pH of the solution. Thus, we need to consider the stoichiometric
reaction between the acid and the base and the equilibrium reaction of the species that
remain.
In contrast to the titration of a strong acid with a strong base, the titration of a weak acid
with a strong base, has these features:
* The initial pH is higher because the weak acid is only partially ionized.
* At the half-neutralization, pH = pKa
. The solution at this point is a buffer solution in
which the concentration of the weak acid and its conjugate base are equal.
* The pH is greater than 7 at the equivalence point because the anion of the weak acid
hydrolyzes.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
106
* The steep portions of the titration curve just prior to and just beyond the equivalence
point is confined to a smaller pH range.
* The choice of indicator for the titration is more limited. The color change must occur
in a basic solution. Generally, the midpoint of the pH range in which the indicator
changes colour must be well above pH 7.
As an example, let us consider the titration of 20 mL of 0.5 M acetic acid, CH3
COOH,
with 0.5 M NaOH. To establish data for the titration curve, we calculate the pH at different
points in the titration, as follows:
a pH before addition of any NaOH
Here we have only 0.5 M acetic acid, and we calculate the equilibrium concentration
of H3O+ ions to calculate the pH.

b pH after the addition of 5.00 mL NaOH
The original number of moles of CH3COOH is 0.5 M × 0.020 L = 0.01 mol.
The moles of OH– added is 0.5 M × 0.005 L = 0.0025 mol.
All the OH– ions have reacted, converting 0.0025 mol CH3
COOH to CH3COO–.
So, at this point we have 0.0025 mol CH3COO– and (0.01 – 0.0025) mol
CH3COOH or 0.0075 mol CH3COOH.

The total volume of the solution is 20 mL + 5 mL = 25 ml = 0.025 L.

0.005 mol CH3COOH.

Unit Summary
• The classical (Arrhenius) definition of acids and bases has many limitations
but still we cannot ignore it.
• The Brønsted-Lowry definition is more general, and considers an acid as a
proton donor and a base as a proton acceptor. In this definition, every acid
has a conjugate base and every base has a conjugate acid. The stronger the
acid, the weaker its conjugate base. Similarly, the stronger a base, the weaker
its conjugate acid.
• According to Lewis, a base is any species that donates an electron pair, and
an acid is any species that accepts an electron pair.
• Water spontaneously ionizes to a slight extent (self-ionization or
autoionization), forming H3O+(aq) and OH–(aq). The extent of ionization is
expressed by the ion-product constant for water, Kw.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
112
• The strength of acids and bases in aqueous solution depends on several factors
such as the percent of dissociation, the dissociation constant, the
concentration of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, pH and pOH.
• The extent to which a weak acid ionizes can be expressed by using the
equilibrium constant for the ionization reaction.
• Generally, we can calculate the hydrogen-ion concentration or pH of an
acid solution at equilibrium, given the initial concentration of the acid and
its Ka value.
• The common-ion effect tends to suppress the ionization of a weak acid or a
weak base. This action can be explained by Le Chatelier’s principle.
• A buffer solution is a combination of either a weak acid and its conjugate
base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. The solution reacts in such a
way that the pH of the solution remains nearly constant. Buffer systems play
a vital role in maintaining the pH of body fluids.
• Acid-base indicators are weak organic acids or bases. They change colour
near the equivalence point in an acid-base neutralization reaction.
• The pH at the equivalence point of an acid-base titration depends on
hydrolysis of the salt formed in the neutralization reaction. For strong acidstrong base titrations, the pH at the equivalence point is 7. For weak acid
strong base titrations, the pH at equivalence point is greater than 7. For
weak base–strong acid titrations, the pH at the equivalence point is less
than 7.
