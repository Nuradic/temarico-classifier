The term oxidation was originally used to describe reactions in which an element combines
with oxygen. For example, the reaction between magnesium and oxygen involves the
oxidation of magnesium: 2Mg(s) + O2(g) → 2MgO(s). However, nowadays it has a
broader meaning that includes reactions not involving only oxygen. Now, oxidation is the
loss of electrons and is identified by an increase in oxidation number.

4.1.2 Reduction
When do we say a substance is reduced? Can oxidation occur without reduction
and vice versa?
The term reduction was originally used to describe the production of a metal from an ore.
The term has been modified through time to include other reactions. Now, reduction is the
gain of electrons and is identified by a decrease in oxidation number.

4.1.3 Balancing Oxidation-Reduction (Redox) Reactions
What scientific law is used in balancing chemical equations?
Because atoms are neither created nor destroyed in an ordinary chemical reaction, chemical
equation must have an equal number of atoms of each element on the reactant and product
sides. In addition, the net electrical charges in the reactant side must be equal to the net
electrical charges in the product side.
Balancing Redox Reactions Using Change in Oxidation-Number Method
How do you balance redox reactions, using the change in the oxidation-number
method?
In a redox reaction, the total number of electrons gained by the oxidizing agent is equal to
the total number of electrons lost by the reducing agent. The change in oxidation number
method for balancing redox reaction is based on this fact.
This method is used to balance redox reactions that do not occur in aqueous solutions, and
also reactions that do not involve ions.
Use the following steps to balance chemical equations, using the change in oxidation state
method.
Step 1: Write an unbalanced chemical equation.
Step 2: Assign oxidation numbers to each atom, and determine which atoms are changing
their oxidation numbers.
Step 3: Determine the number of electrons lost by each atom per molecule undergoing
oxidation and the number of electrons gained by each atom per molecule being
reduced.
Step 4: Balance the number of electrons lost in oxidation with those gained in reduction
by adjusting the coefficients of substances being oxidized and reduced.
Step 5: Balance the remaining substances by counting atoms.
Step 6: Check the final equation to be sure that each atom as well as the net charges on
either side is balanced.
Example 4.1
Balance the following chemical equation, using the change in oxidation-number
method.
C H SO CO SO H O + → ++ 24 2 2 2

Step 1: C H SO CO SO H O + → ++ 24 2 2 2

4 electrons lost
2 electrons gained
Step 4: C + H SO 2 2 4 CO + SO + H O 2 22 2
1 ×4=4 electrons lost
2 ×2=4 electrons gained
Step 5: Balance hydrogen atoms by making the coefficient of water 2.
C 2H SO CO 2SO 2H O + →+ + 24 2 2 2
Step 6: Reactants Products
 C (1) C (1)
 H (4) H (4)
 S (2) S (2)
 O (8) O (8)
The chemical equation is balanced, because the number of atoms in the reactant side is
equal to the number of atoms in the product side. It can also be confirmed that the net
charge is zero on each side.
Example 4.2
Balance the following chemical equation by using the change in oxidation-number
method.
Cu HNO Cu(NO ) NO H O + → ++ 3 3 2 2
Solution:
Step 1: Cu HNO Cu(NO ) NO H O + → ++ 3 3 2 2
Step 2: Cu + HNO3 Cu(NO + NO + H O 3 2 2 )
0 +1+5 -2 +2 +5 -2 +2 -2 +1 -2

4.1.4 The Ion-Electron Method for Balancing Redox Reactions
This method is useful if the net ionic equation is given or no spectator ions are present.
For example,
Na+(aq) + S2–(aq) + H+(aq) + Cl–
(aq) + NO3
– (aq) → Na+(aq) + Cl–
(aq) + S(s) + NO (g) + H2
O(l)
In this reaction, Na+(aq) and Cl–(aq) ions are spectator ions, because they appear on both
the reactant and product sides. Therefore, the net ionic equation becomes:
2 S (aq) H (aq) NO (aq) NO(g) S(s) H O(l) 3 2
−+ − + + → ++
Steps for balancing redox reaction using the ion-electron method:
Step 1: Identify the element undergoing oxidation and reduction; write separate
equations for oxidation and reduction half-reactions.
Step 2: Balance the element oxidized or reduced.
Step 3: Determine the change in oxidation number of the element oxidized or reduced.
Add the electrons gained or lost to the side on which the redox element has the
higher oxidation number.
Step 4: Balance any elements other than hydrogen and oxygen that may be present.
Step 5: Balance charges by adding H+ ions if the solution is acidic and OH– ions if the
solution is basic.
Step 6: Balance hydrogen by adding water molecules.
Step 7: Multiply each half-reaction by appropriate coefficients so that the number of
electrons lost in oxidation equals the number of electrons gained in reduction.
Step 8: Add the two half-reactions together and eliminate anything that appears in
identical form on both sides of the equation.

of molten electrolytes;

• distinguish between molten electrolytes and aqueous solutions of electrolytes.
Before we study the electrolysis of aqueous solutions, let us consider some important
concepts about conductivity. As you learned in Grade 10 Chemistry, electrical conductivity
is the ability of a substance to transmit electricity. Generally, there are two major types of
electrical conductors: metallic conductors and electrolytic conductors.
Activity 4.2
Form a group. Discuss the following points and present your answers to the class. Your
teacher might help you to form groups.
1. How does conduction occur in metals and in electrolytes?
2. What do substances need in order to conduct electricity?
3. What are the physical states in which metals and electrolytes conduct electricity?
4. Can ionic compounds conduct electricity in the solid state? If your answer is "No", why?
Aqueous solutions can be tested for the presence of mobile ions by using an electric circuit
like the one in Figure 4.1.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
166
Figure 4.1 Electrical Conductivity Apparatus.
This circuit consists of a current source, a light bulb, and two graphite rods called electrodes
that dip into the solution. If the solution contains ions, current flows through the circuit and
the light bulb glows. The brightness of the bulb increases with current strength, which
increases with the number of ions in the solution.
The ability of different solutes to provide ions can be compared by comparing the brightness
of the light bulb at the same concentration.
Note that metallic conduction is a physical process, but electrolytic conduction causes
chemical changes to occur on the surface of the electrodes.

4.2.2 Preferential Discharge
What does preferential discharge mean? What are the factors that affect
preferential discharge of ions?
The preferential discharge of ions is affected by the nature of the electrodes, the positions
of the ions in the electrochemical series and the concentration of the ions in the electrolyte.
Let us discuss these factors one by one.
1. Nature of the electrodes
How do electrodes affect the preferential discharge of ions?
Inert electrodes, like graphite or platinum, do not affect the product of electrolysis, but
reactive or active electrodes, like copper, can affect the product of electrolysis.
For example, in the electrolysis of copper sulphate solutions, using graphite electrodes,
ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 4)
169
oxygen gas is liberated at the anode and copper metal is deposited at the cathode, as
shown below.
CuSO4(aq) —→ Cu2+(aq) + SO4
2– (aq)
Anode : 4OH– (aq) —→ O2 (g) + 2H2O (l) + 4e–
Cathode : Cu2+(aq) + 2e– —→ Cu (s)
However, if the electrolysis of copper sulphate is performed using copper electrodes,
the copper electrode at the anode dissolves and copper metal will be deposited at the
cathode, as indicated below.
Anode : Cu (s) —→ Cu2+(aq) + 2e–
Cathode : Cu2+(aq) + 2e–—→ Cu(s)
2. The position of the ions in the electrochemical series
The reactivity series or activity series is an empirical series of metals, in order of
"reactivity" from highest to lowest. It is used to summarize information about the reactions
of metals with acids and water, single displacement reactions and the extraction of
metals from their ores. The electrochemical series is built up by arranging various redox
equilibria in order of their standard electrode potentials (redox potentials). The values
of standard electrode potentials are given in the Table 4.2 in volts relative to the
standard hydrogen electrode. You will learn more about standard electrode potentials
in this unit.
The reactivity series is sometimes quoted in the reverse order of standard electrode
potentials:
Li > K > Sr > Ca > Na > Mg > Al > Zn > Cr > Fe > Cd > Co > Ni > Sn > Pb
> H > Cu > Ag > Hg > Pt > Au
The positions of lithium and sodium are changed on such a series; gold and platinum are
also inverted, although this has little practical significance as both metals are highly
unreactive.
Standard electrode potentials offer a quantitative measure of the power of a reducing
agent, rather than the qualitative considerations of other reactivity series. However, they
are only valid for standard conditions. In particular, they only apply to reactions in
aqueous solution. Even with this provision, the electrode potentials of lithium and sodium,
and hence their positions in the electrochemical series, appear anomalous. The order of
reactivity, as shown by the vigor of the reaction with water or the speed at which the
metal surface tarnishing in air, appears to be:
potassium > sodium > lithium > alkaline earth metals

The ions that are lower in the electrochemical series get discharged in preference to
those above them.
For example, if a solution has potassium ions and copper ions, the copper ions will
accept electrons, and get discharged as copper atoms first. The potassium ions will not
be affected.
In general, if two or more positive ions migrate to the cathode, the ion lower in the series
is discharged preferentially. Similarly, if two or more negative ions migrate to the anode,
the ion lower in the series is discharged preferentially.
3. Concentration of the ions in the electrolyte
If an electrolyte contains a higher concentration of ions that are higher in the
electrochemical series than of those that are lower, then the higher ions get discharged
in preference to the lower ones.
For example, a solution of sodium chloride in water contains two types of anions i.e.,
the chloride (Cl–) ions and the hydroxide (OH–) ions. The hydroxide ions are lower in
the electrochemical series than the chloride ions. But if the concentration of chloride ions
is much higher than that of the hydroxide ions, then the chloride ions get discharged first.

3. For the electrolysis of molten KCl, write a balanced equation for the:
a anode reaction

4. Why are H+ and Cl– ions discharged in preference to Na+ and OH– ions in concentrated
sodium chloride solution?
After the discussion, share your ideas with the rest of the class.
Electrolysis of concentrated sodium chloride solution (brine solution)
Concentrated solution of sodium chloride (brine solution) contains Na+, Cl–, H+ and
OH– ions. However, the concentrations of H+ and OH– are very small. Why? When
a potential difference is established across the two electrodes, Na+ and H+ ions move
towards the cathode, and Cl– and OH– ions move towards the anode. At the cathode,
the H+ ions are discharged in preference to the Na+ ions. Similarly, Cl– ions are discharged
at the anode in preference to the OH–
 ions because the concentration of Cl–
 ions is very high.

Electrolysis of Dilute Sulphuric Acid Solution
Which ions are discharged at the cathode and anode?
Dilute sulphuric acid solution contains H+, OH– and SO4
2– ions. When a potential
difference is applied across the two electrodes (anode and cathode), only H+ ions
migrate towards the cathode, and OH– and SO4
2– ions migrate towards the anode.
At the cathode, H+ ions are discharged, and at the anode, OH– ions are discharged in
preference to SO4
2– ions because the hydroxide ion is below the SO4
2 – ion in the
electrochemical series.
Anode (oxidation) : 4 OH–(aq) → 2H2O(l) + O2(g) + 4e–
Cathode (reduction) : [2H+(aq) + 2e– → H2(g)] × 2
Overall reaction : 2H2O(l) → 2H2(g) + O2(g)
Note that the electrolysis of dilute NaCl and dilute H2SO4 solutions results in the
decomposition of water to oxygen and hydrogen gases.
Electrolysis of Copper (II) Sulphate, Using Inert Electrodes
Which ions are liberated at the cathode and anode if copper sulphate solution
is electrolysed, using platinum (inert) electrodes?
Copper sulphate solution contains Cu2+, H+, SO4
2– and OH– ions. When a potential
difference is established between the two electrodes, Cu2+ and H+ ions migrate towards
the cathode, and SO4
2 – and OH– ions migrate towards the anode.
At the cathode, the Cu2+ ions are discharged in preference to the H+ ions, because
copper is below hydrogen in the electrochemical series. Similarly, at the anode, the OH–
ions are discharged in preference to the SO4
2 – ions.
Anode (oxidation) : 4OH–(aq) → 2H2O(l) + O2(g) + 4e–
Cathode (reduction) : [Cu2+(aq) + 2e– → Cu(s)] × 2
Overall reaction : 2Cu2+(aq) + 4OH–(aq) → 2Cu(s) + 2H2O(l) + O2(g)
Since copper ions are deposited at the cathode, and hydroxide ions at the anode, the
solution becomes acidic due to the formation of H2
SO4.

Michael Faraday (1791-1867), was a British physicist and
chemist, best known for his discoveries of electromagnetic
induction and of the laws of electrolysis.
Faraday was born on September 22, 1791, in Newington,
Surrey, England. He was the son of a blacksmith and
received little formal education. While apprenticed to a
bookbinder in London, he read books on scientific subjects
and experimented with electricity. In 1812, he attended a
series of lectures given by the British chemist Sir Humphry
Davy and forwarded the notes he took at these lectures to
Davy, together with a request for employment. Davy
Faraday, Michael employed Faraday as an assistant in his chemical laboratory
Biography
at the Royal Institution, and in 1813 took Faraday with him on an extended tour of
Europe. Faraday was elected to the Royal Society in 1824, and the following year he was
appointed director of the laboratory of the Royal Institution. In 1833, he succeeded Davy
as professor of chemistry at the institution. Two years later he was given a pension of 300
pounds per year for life. Faraday was the recipient of many scientific honors, including
the Royal and Rumford medals of the Royal Society; he was also offered the presidency
of the society but declined the honour. He died on August 25, 1867, near Hampton
Court, Surrey.

After completing this subunit, you will be able to:
• state Faraday’s first law of electrolysis;
• write the mathematical expressions for the Faraday’s first law of electrolysis;

• state Faraday's second law of electrolysis;
• write the mathematical expressions for Faraday’s second law of electrolysis; and
• do calculations related to Faraday’s second law of electrolysis.
Is it possible to calculate the amount of product formed at the electrodes?
The quantitative treatment of electrolysis was developed primarily by Michael Faraday
in the year 1834. His early research on electrolysis led him to propose a relationship
between the amount of current passed through a solution and the amount of substance
decomposed or produced by the current.
ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 4)
177
4.3.1 Faraday's First Law of Electrolysis
Faraday's First Law states that “the amount of substance consumed or produced at
one of the electrodes in an electrolytic cell is directly proportional to the amount of
electricity that passes through the cell”.
If m is the mass of a substance librated or deposited at an electrode due to the passage
of charge Q, then according to Faraday's first law of electrolysis,
m ∝ Q or m = zQ
Where z is a constant of proportionality and is called electrochemical equivalent of the
substance. It has the same charge which passes due to a steady current I flowing for
time t, then the above equation can be written as:
m = z × I × t
 = z × Q
Show that the general formula of Faraday’s first law is given by : m =

For example, in the electrolysis of molten NaCl, the cathode reaction tells us that one
Na atom is produced when one Na+ ion accepts an electron from the cathode. To
reduce 1 mole of Na+ ions, we must supply one mole of electrons (6.02 × 1023 electrons)
to the cathode.
Example 4.4
How many moles of chlorine, magnesium and aluminium are formed when 2, 2
and 3 moles of charge are passed through three different solution containing
chloride, magnesium and aluminium ions respectively?
Solution:
The stoichiometry of the anode reaction shows that oxidation of two Cl– ions
yields one chlorine molecule and releases two electrons. Therefore, the formation
of 1 mole of chlorine results in 2 moles of electrons supplied by the Cl– ions
to the anode. Similarly, it takes 2 moles of electrons to reduce 1 mole of Mg2+
ions and 3 moles of electrons to reduce 1 mole of Al3+ ions:

2Cl–(l) → Cl2(g) + 2e–
Mg2+ (aq) + 2e– → Mg(s)
Al3+(l) + 3e– → Al(s)
In an electrolysis experiment, we generally measure the current in amperes (A) that pass
through an electrolytic cell in a given period of time. By definition, 1 coulomb of charge
is transferred when a 1 ampere current flows for 1 second:
1 C = 1 A × 1 s
The charge on 1 mole of electrons is 96,500 C, which is obtained by multiplying 1 mol
(6.02 × 1023 electrons) with the charge of electron (1.602 × 10–19 C).
Charge of 1 mol of electrons = 6.02 × 1023 electrons × 1.602 ×10–19 C
= 96, 485 C ≈ 96,500 C = 1 F (one faraday)
Therefore, 1F = 96,500 C.mol–1.
Example 4.5
Calculate the mass of calcium metal and chlorine gas that can be produced when
a current of 0.452 A is passed through molten CaCl2 for 1.5 h.
Solution:
In solving electrolysis problems of this type, the first step is to determine which
species will be oxidized at the anode and which species will be reduced at the
cathode. Here the choice is straightforward because we only have Ca2+ and Cl–
ions in molten CaCl2. Thus, we write the half and overall reactions as:
Anode (oxidation) : 2Cl–(l) → Cl2(g) + 2e–
Cathode (reduction) : Ca2+(l) + 2e– → Ca(l)
Overall reaction : Ca2+(l) + 2Cl–(l) → Ca(l) + Cl2(g)
The quantities of calcium metal and chlorine gas formed depend on the number
of electrons that pass through the electrolytic cell, which in turn depends on
current × time or charge.

Solution:
Recall that, from the electrolysis of dilute H2
SO4
, we have:
Anode (oxidation) : 4 OH–(aq) → 2H2O (l) + O2(g) + 4e–
Cathode (reduction) : 4H+(aq) + 4e– → 2H2(g)
Overall reaction : 2H2O(l) → 2H2(g) + O2(g)
First let us calculate the total charge.
Given: I = 1.26 A
t = 7.44 h = 7.44 × 60 × 60 s = 26,784 s
 Q = It = (1.26 A) × (26, 784 s) = 3.37 × 104 C
The above balanced chemical equation shows that for 1 mole of O2 formed at
the anode, 4 moles of electrons are generated. Now let us calculate the number

4.3.2 Faraday's Second Law of Electrolysis
Faraday's second law of electrolysis states that “when the same quantity of charge (Q)
is passed through different electrolytes, then the masses of different substances deposited
(m1, m2, m3,...) at the respective electrodes will be directly proportional to their equivalent
masses (E1, E2, E3,...).”
m ∝ E
or, m1 ∝ E1, m2 ∝ E2, and m3 ∝ E3 etc.
Replacing the proportionality by a proportionality constant k, the equations become:
M1/E1 = M2/E2 = M3/E3 = .... = k
The law can be illustrated by passing the same quantity of electric current through three
solutions containing H2SO4, CuSO4 and AgNO3, connected in series, as shown in
Figure 4.6.

What happens if zinc metal is immersed in copper (II) sulphate solution?
When zinc metal is immersed in copper sulphate solution, some zinc dissolves and some
copper metal forms on the surface of the remaining zinc.
The net reaction,
Cu2+(aq) + Zn(s) → Cu(s) + Zn2+(aq)
is an oxidation-reduction reaction (redox reaction) in which electrons are transferred
from zinc atoms to copper ions.
ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 4)
187
The half-reaction equations are:
Oxidation half-reaction : Zn(s) → Zn2+ (aq) + 2e–
Reduction half-reaction : Cu2+(aq) + 2e– → Cu(s)
Since the copper sulphate solution is in contact with the zinc metal, the electrons flow
directly from the zinc metal atoms to the copper ions without doing useful work. If the
half-reactions could be made to occur in separate compartments, and the electrons
were transferred through an external wire from one compartment to the other, then we
would have a Galvanic cell capable of doing electrical work.
A Galvanic cell was invented by the British Chemist John Daniell in 1836. It is called
the Daniell cell. A diagram of this cell is as shown in Figure 4.7.

Figure 4.7 Daniell cell.
One compartment of the Daniell cell contains a zinc electrode immersed in a solution
of zinc sulphate (ZnSO4). The other compartment contains a copper electrode in a
solution of copper sulphate (CuSO4). When the two electrodes are connected by a
wire, the zinc atoms give up electrons, forming positive ions:
Zn(s) → Zn2+(aq) + 2e–
The zinc ions repel each other and enter the solution. The negative electrons also repel
each other and travel through the external wire to the copper electrode, where they are
accepted by copper ions from the surrounding solution:
Cu2+(aq) + 2e– → Cu(s)
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
188
The resulting copper atoms deposit as the copper metal on the surface of copper
electrode. The Daniell cell reaction is identical to the reaction that occurs when zinc
metal is dipped directly into copper sulphate solution (zinc atoms are oxidized and
copper ions are reduced), but the cell is constructed so that the electrons pass through
an external circuit where they can do useful work.
The solutions in the two halves of a Galvanic cell must be connected in order to
complete the circuit, but they must not mix. The connection can be made through a salt
bridge (see Figure 4.7).
A salt bridge is an inverted U-tube filled with an electrolyte, such as NH4NO3 or KCl,
chosen so that it does not interfere with the operation of the cell. Regardless of how
the cell is constructed, the solutions in each compartment remain more or less separated.
Furthermore, because ions can move into and out of the salt bridge, the solutions remain
electrically neutral.
How does the salt bridge maintain the electroneutrality of a solution?
Consider the zinc compartment. The oxidation of zinc atoms tends to build up the
concentration of positive zinc ions in a solution around the zinc electrode. Some of the
charge is neutralized by negative ions flowing out of the salt bridge and enter into the
zinc compartment, and the rest of zinc ions flow out of the compartment into the salt
bridge.
Now consider the copper compartment. The reduction of copper ions tends to decrease
the concentration of positive copper ions around the copper electrode. The resulting
negative charge is neutralized, partially by positive ions flowing from the salt bridge and
enter into the copper compartment, and partially by negative sulphate ions flowing out
of the compartment. If the flow of ions did not occur, a charge difference would build
up between the compartments, and the reaction would stop. Every Galvanic cell has an
oxidation half-reaction and a reduction half-reaction. The compartments in which these
reactions occur (and their associated electrodes) are referred to as half-cells.
What are the anode and the cathode in a Galvanic cell?
The electrode where oxidation takes place is called the anode, and the electrode where
reduction takes place is the cathode. In the Daniell cell, the zinc electrode is the anode
and the copper electrode is the cathode. The anode sends electrons through the connecting
wire (it is the electron source or negative terminal of the cell). The cathode receives
electrons, so it is a positive terminal. When the terminals of a Galvanic cell are connected
by an external circuit, there will always be a flow of electrons from anode to cathode
through the external circuit.
Note that the electrode polarities in Galvanic cells are the reverse of those in an
electrolytic cell.

4.5.2 Cell Notation
How do you represent Galvanic cells without drawing a diagram?
A cell notation allows us to describe a Galvanic cell without drawing a diagram. It is
a shorthand representation of a Galvanic cell. For example, a Daniell cell in which the
electrolyte concentrations are each 1 molar is represented as
2 2 Zn(s) Zn (1 M) Cu (1 M) Cu(s) + +
The anode is written on the left. The cathode on the right and concentrations and other
data are given in parentheses. The vertical line (|) indicates phase boundaries, and the
double vertical line (||) indicates a salt bridge or a porous partition.
The cell notation for the Daniell cell tells us that the zinc anode is dipped into a 1 M
solution of zinc ions, the copper cathode is dipped into a 1 M solution of copper ions,
and the two half-cells are separated by a salt bridge or a porous partition. If the two
half-cells were in direct contact, the double vertical line would be replaced by single line.
The notation for any Galvanic cell has the following form:
anode | anode electrolyte (M) || cathode electrolyte (M) | cathode
Every redox reaction is the sum of an oxidation half-reaction and a reduction halfreaction written in such a way as to cancel out the electrons by suitably multiplying the
half-reactions by the minimum integers.
Example 4.8
Write the cell notation for a Galvanic cell, based on this reaction:
Fe(s) + Hg2

3. a Explain the difference between a Galvanic cell and an electrolytic cell.

4.5.3 Standard Reduction Potentials
What is the difference between standard reduction potential and cell
potential?
The cell potential is the difference between two electrode potentials, one associated with
the cathode and the other associated with the anode.
By convention, the potential associated with each electrode is chosen to be the potential
for reduction to occur at the electrode. Thus, standard electrode potentials (electrode
potentials at a concentration of 1 M) are tabulated for reduction reactions and are
denoted as Eo
red. The cell potential (Eo
cell)is Eo
red (cathode) minus the standard reduction
potential of the anode reaction, Eo
red (anode):
Eo
cell= Eo
red (cathode) – Eo
red (anode)
Because every Galvanic cell involves two half-cells, it is not possible to directly measure
the standard reduction potential of a half-reaction. However, if we assign a standard
reduction potential to a certain reference half-reaction, we can then determine the
standard reduction potentials of the other half-reactions, relative to that reference. The
reference half-reaction is the reduction of H+(aq) to H2(g) under standard conditions,
which is given a standard reduction potential of exactly 0.0 V.
2H+ (aq, 1M) + 2e– → H2(g, 1 atm); Eo
red = 0.0 V
An electrode designed to produce this half-reaction is called a standard hydrogen
electrode (SHE). As depicted in Figure 4.8, SHE consists of platinum wire connected
to a piece of platinum foil covered with finely-divided platinum that serves as an inert
surface for the reaction. The electrode is encased in a glass tube, so that hydrogen gas
can bubble over the platinum, and the solution contains H+(aq) under standard (1 M)
conditions.

The spontaneous reaction in Figure 4.8, is the oxidation of zinc and the reduction of

In the Figure 4.8, above;
i) The Zn2+ | Zn electrode is the anode, and the SHE is the cathode.
ii) The cell voltage is 0.76 V.
By using the defined standard reduction potential of H+ , we can determine the standard
reduction potential for Zn2+ | Zn half-reaction:
Eo
cell = Eo
red (cathode) – Eo
red (anode)
0.76 V = 0.0 V – Eo
red (anode)
⇒ Eo
red (anode) = –0.76 V
 Therefore, a standard reduction potential of –0.76 V can be assigned to the reduction
of Zn2+ to Zn:
Zn2+ (aq, 1M) + 2e– → Zn(s); Eo
red = –0.76 V
Note that we write the reaction as a reduction, even though it occurs in reverse as
oxidation. Whenever we assign a potential to a half-reaction, we write the reaction as
a reduction.

red values apply to the half-cell reactions as read in the forward (left to

2. The more positive Eo

Li+ (1M) + e– → Li(s), Eo
red = –3.05 V
which has the most negative Eo
red value. Thus, Li+ is the weakest oxidizing agent,
because it is the most difficult species to be reduced. Alternatively, Li metal is the
strongest reducing agent since it gets oxidized most readily.
3. Under standard state conditions, any species on the left of a given cell reaction
reacts spontaneously with a species that appears on the right of any half-cell
reaction that is located below it in Table 4.2. This principle is sometimes called
the diagonal rule. In the case of the Daniell cell,
Cu2+ (1 M) + 2e– → Cu(s); Eo
red = +0.34 V
Zn2+ (1 M) + 2e– → Zn(s); Eo
red = –0.76 V
We see that the substance on the left of the first half-cell reaction is Cu2+, and
on the right in the second half-cell reaction is Zn. Therefore, Zn spontaneously
reduces Cu2+ to form Zn2+ and Cu.
4. Changing the stoichometric coefficients of a half-cell reaction does not affect the
value of Eo
red, because electrode potentials are intensive properties. This means
that the value of Eo
red is unaffected by the size of the electrodes or the amount
of solutions present but is dependent on the concentration of the solutions and the
pressure of a gas (if any).
For example,
I
2(s) + 2e– → 2I– (1M); Eo
red = +0.53 V
but Eo does not change if we multiply the half-reaction by 2:
2I2(s) + 4e– → 4I– (1M); Eo
red = +0.53 V
 5. The sign of Eo
red changes, but its magnitude remains the same when we reverse
a reaction.
6. The more positive the reduction potential, the greater the tendency to accept
electrons. As a result, when two half-cells are coupled, the reaction with higher
(more positive) reduction potential proceeds as reduction, while the other proceeds
as oxidation.

Example 4.9
A Galvanic cell consists of a Mg electrode in 1.0 M Mg(NO3)
2 solution and a
Ag electrode in 1.0 M AgNO3 solution. Calculate the standard cell potential
(emf) of this cell at 25°C.
Solution:
Using Table 4.2, it can be noticed that Ag+ will oxidize Mg:
Anode (oxidation) : Mg(s) → Mg2+ (1 M) + 2e– ; Eo
red = +2.37 V
Cathode (reduction) : 2Ag+ (1 M) + 2e– → 2Ag(s); Eo
red = +0.80 V
Overall reaction : Mg(s) + 2Ag+ (1 M) → Mg2+ (1 M) + 2Ag(s)
Eo
cell = 2.37 V + 0.80 V = +3.17 V
Note that, in order to balance the overall reaction, we multiplied the cathode
reaction by 2. We can do so because, Eo
red is an intensive property, which
means it is not affected by this procedure. We can also find the Eo
cell by using
the principle stated in number 6 above.
Ag+ (1.0 M) + e–→ Ag+(s), Eo
red = +0.80 V (Cathode: higher reduction potential)
Mg2+ (1.0 M) + 2e– → Mg(s), Eo
red = – 2.37 V (Anode: lower reduction potential)
Eo
red = Eo
red (cathode) – Eo
red (anode)
 = Eo
red (Ag+/Ag) – Eo
red (Mg2+/Mg)
 = 0.80 V – (–2.37 V) = +3.17 V
The positive value of Eo
cell shows that the forward reaction is favoured.

4.5.4 Electromotive Force (emf)
Activity 4.11
Form a group. Discuss the following question.
Why does water in a river flow downhill rather than uphill? How do you relate this
concept to the movement of electrons in a wire? After the discussion, share your ideas
with the rest of the class.
When electrons move through a wire, they encounter resistance from localised atoms
in their paths. The driving force that allows the electrons to overcome this resistance and
move around the circuit is called electromotive force (emf).
The electromotive force in a Galvanic cell comes from the redox reaction that pushes
electrons from the anode to a cathode through the external circuit. Electrons on the
negative electrode repel each other and have more potential energy than electrons on
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12
198
the positive electrode. This potential difference causes electrons to flow through the
external circuit from the negative terminal (anode) to the positive terminal (cathode).
The energy of the moving electrons is used to overcome resistance in the external circuit,
and it can be used to do various forms of electrical work. Energy that overcomes
resistance appears as heat or as light emitted by a glowing filament. Electrical work is
used for starting cars, running watches, radios, and computers etc.
Electrical work (W) is the product of the emf of the cell and the total charge (in
coulombs) that passes through the cell:
W = Q × E
where Q is the charge and E is electrical potential.
Electrical energy = coulombs × volts = joules
The total charge is determined by the number of moles of electrons (n) that pass through
the circuit.
By definition,
Q = nF
where F, the Faraday constant, is the total electrical charge contained in 1 mole of
electrons.
1 F = 96,500 C/mol e–
Because 1 J = 1 C × 1 V,
We can also express the unit of Faraday as 1 F = 96, 500 J/V. mol e–.
The measured emf is the maximum voltage that the cell can achieve. This value is used
to calculate the maximum amount of electrical energy that can be obtained from the
chemical reaction. This energy is used to do electrical work (Wele), so
Wmax = Wele = – nFEcell
where, Wmax is the maximum amount of work that can be done.
What does the negative sign indicate?
The change in free energy (∆G) represents the maximum amount of useful work that
can be obtained from a reaction.
∆G = Wmax
⇒ ∆G = Wmax = – nFEcell
∆G = – nFEcell
ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 4)
199
Both n and F are positive quantities, and ∆G is negative for a spontaneous process,
so Ecell must be positive. Therefore, a positive Ecell value corresponds to a negative ∆G
value, which is the condition for spontaneity.
For standard state conditions,
∆G° = – nFE°
cell
Now we can relate E°cell to the equilibrium constant (K) of a redox reaction. The
standard free energy change, ∆G°, for a reaction is related to its equilibrium constant,
as follows.
∆G° = – RT ln K
If we substitute ∆G° by – nFE°
cell it becomes + nFE°
cell = + RT ln K
⇒ nFE°

The half-reactions are:

we can calculate ∆G°, using the following equation:
∆G° = – nFE°
cell
 = – 6 × (96500 J/V mol) × (– 4.37 V)
 = 2.53 × 106 J/mol = 2.53 × 103 kJ/mol
Therefore, the large positive value of ∆G° tells us that the reaction favours the
reactants at equilibrium. The forward reaction is non-spontaneous, that is, gold
cannot reduce calcium.

4.5.5 Dependence of emf on Concentration
What is the effect of changing the concentration of reactants on cell
potential?
A change in concentration affects the change of cell potential which is a result of free
energy change. According to chemical thermodynamics
∆G = ∆Go + RT ln Q
Where, Q is the reaction quotient, and Q was used to calculate the effect of concentration
on ∆G. Since ∆G = – nFEcell and ∆Go = – nFE o
cell, the equation becomes
– nFE cell = – nFE o
cell + RT ln Q
Dividing each side of the equation by – nF gives
E = E o
cell − ln RT Q nF
This equation gives the relationship between the cell potential and the concentrations of
the cell components and is called the Nernst equation.
At 25°C:

or cell
0.0592 E = − E° log Q
n
During the operation of a Galvanic cell, electrons flow from the anode to the cathode,
resulting in product formation and a decrease in reactant concentration. Thus Q increases,
which means that Ecell decreases. Eventually, the cell reaction reaches equilibrium. At
equilibrium, there is no net transfer of electrons, so Ecell = 0 and Q = K, where K is
the equilibrium constant.
The above equation enables us to calculate Ecell as a function of reactant and product
concentrations in a redox reaction. For monovalent ions ten-fold changes in concentration
of solution will cause a change of 0.0592 volts and bivalent a change of 0.0592/2 volts.
For example, for the Daniell cell,
Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) → Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s), Eo
cell = 1.10 V

The equation for this cell at 25°C can be written as:
Ecell =

+ −
Note that the concentration of liquids and solids is constant and does not appear in
the equilibrium constant expression. If the ratio [Zn2+]/[Cu2+] is less than 1, then
log ([Zn2+]/[Cu2+]) is a negative number. Therefore, the second term on the right-hand
side of the preceding equation is positive. Under this condition, Ecell is greater than
the standard cell potential. If the ratio is greater than 1, Ecell is smaller than Eo
cell.
Example 4.12
Predict whether the following reaction would proceed spontaneously, as written
at 298 K, given that [Co2+] = 0.15 M and [Fe2+] = 0.68 M :
Co(s) + Fe2+(aq) → Co2+(aq) + Fe(s)
Solution :
Because the reaction is not run under standard state conditions (concentrations
are not 1 M), we need the equation to calculate the emf (Ecell) of Galvanic cell.
The standard emf (E°cell) can be calculated, using the standard reduction potentials
in Table 4.2.

ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 4)
205
A battery is a Galvanic cell, or a series of combined Galvanic cells, that can be used as a
source of direct current at a constant voltage.
The principal advantages offered by batteries are convenience and portability, rather
than efficient use of energy.
Based on their rechargeability, we can classify batteries as primary and secondary.
Primary batteries use redox reactions that cannot be returned to their original
state by recharging, so when the reaction is complete, the batteries become
“dead” and must be discarded. Secondary batteries are often called storage
batteries, or rechargeable batteries. The reactions in these batteries can be
reversed, which means that the batteries can be recharged. They have the advantage
of being more cost-efficient in the long term although the individual batteries are
more expensive.

1. about working of car battery;
2. how do they come to know whether a car battery needs recharging;

Figure 4.10 The interior section of a dry cell battery.
The voltage produced by a dry cell is about 1.5 V. The LeClanchè cells are widely
used because of their low cost, but they have several disadvantages. If the current is
drawn from the battery very rapidly, the gaseous products cannot be consumed
immediately. As a result, the cell resistance increases and the voltage drop. In addition,
since an ammonium ion is a weak conjugate acid, the zinc electrode and ammonium ion
react very slowly. Because of this reaction, these voltaic cells cannot be stored indefinitely.
You have probably learned from experience that, when the zinc outer cover deteriorates,
the electrolyte can leak out and damage the flashlight or other appliances in which it
contained.
Alkaline Battery
Alkaline batteries are more expensive than LeClanchè batteries. Why? They can generate
current up to 50% longer than the same size of dry cell batteries. The chemistry of
alkaline cells is quite similar to that of LeClanchè cells, except that the material inside
the cell is basic or alkaline. Alkaline cells use the oxidation of zinc and reduction of
MnO2
 to generate a current, but NaOH or KOH is used in the cell instead of the acidic
salt NH4Cl.
Anode : Zn(s) + 2OH–(aq) → ZnO(s) + H2O(l) + 2e–
Cathode : 2MnO2(s) + H2O(l) + 2e– → Mn2O3(s) + 2OH–(aq)
Write the overall balanced chemical equation.
The additional advantage of alkaline cells is that the cell potential does not decline under
high current loads, because no gases are formed.
ELECTROCHEMISTRY (UNIT 4)

Mercury cells are alkaline cells that are typically used in calculators, cameras, watches
and other devices. The anode in a mercury cell is again metallic zinc, but the cathode
is mercury (II) oxide.
Anode : Zn(s) + 2OH–(aq) → ZnO(s) + H2O(l) + 2e–
Cathode : HgO(s) + H2O(l) + 2e– → Hg(s) + 2OH–(aq)
Write the overall balanced chemical equation.
The cell produces 1.35 V. These cells are widely used, but their disposal is an
environmental problem, and there are ongoing efforts to phase them out. Mercury and
its compounds are poisonous. So, mercury batteries should be reprocessed to recover
the metal at the end of their useful lives.
Nickel-Cadmium Battery
Because dry cells are not rechargeable, they have to be replaced frequently. The nickelcadmium battery is rechargeable and especially is used in battery-operated tools and
portable computers.
The cadmium metal serves as the anode, and the NiO2(s), which is reduced to
Ni(OH)2(s), serves as the cathode. The cell reactions are:
Anode : Cd(s) + 2OH–(aq) U Cd(OH)2(s) + 2e–
Cathode : NiO2(s) + 2H2O(l) + 2e– U Ni(OH)2(s) + 2OH–(aq)
Overall reaction : NiO2(s) + Cd(s) + 2H2O(l) U Ni(OH)2(s) + Cd(OH)2(s)
The solid reaction products, Ni(OH)2 and Cd(OH)2, adhere to the electrodes. This
permits the reactions to be readily reversed during charging.
The Lead Storage Battery
The lead storage battery commonly used in automobiles consists of six identical cells
joined together in series. This is an example of a secondary rechargeable cell. The
reactions within the cell can be reversed. Each cell has a lead anode and a cathode
made up of lead oxide (PbO2) packed on a metal plate.
Both the cathode and the anode are immersed in an aqueous solution of sulphuric acid
which acts as the electrolyte. Figure 4.11 depicted the typical lead storage battery. The
cell reactions are:
Anode : Pb(s) + SO4

Fuel Cells
What makes a fuel cell different from other types of batteries?
Fossil fuels are major sources of energy, but the conversion of fossil fuel into electrical
energy is a highly inefficient process.
Consider the combustion of methane:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l) + Energy
To generate electricity, heat produced by the reaction is first used to convert water to
steam, which then drives a turbine that drives a generator. A significant fraction of the
energy released in the form of heat is lost to the surroundings at each step. Even the
most efficient power plants convert only about 40% of the original chemical energy into
electricity. Because combustion reactions are redox reactions, it is more desirable to
carry them out directly by electrochemical means, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency
of the power production. This objective can be accomplished by a device known as a
fuel cell.
A fuel cell is a Galvanic cell that requires a continuous supply of reactants to keep
functioning. In its simplest form, a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell consists of an electrolyte
solution such as sodium hydroxide solution, and two inert electrodes. The hydrogen
and oxygen gases are bubbled through the anode and cathode compartments. See
Figure 4.12.

Overall reaction : 2H2(g) + O2(aq) → 2H2O(l)

E°cell = E°red (cathode) – E°red (anode)
= 0.40 V – (– 0.83 V)

Thus, the cell reaction is spontaneous under standard state conditions. Note that the reaction
is the same as the hydrogen combustion reaction, except that the oxidation and reduction
are carried out separately at the anode and the cathode. Unlike batteries, fuel cells do not
store chemical energy. Reactants must be continuously supplied, and products must be
continuously removed from a fuel cell.

4.5.7 Corrosion of Metals
What are the causes of corrosion?
Corrosion is the term usually applied to the deterioration of metals by an electrochemical
process. It causes enormous damage to buildings, bridges, ships, and cars.
Can you give more examples of materials that can be damaged by corrosion
from your environment?
Corrosion reactions are redox reactions in which a metal is attacked by some substance in
its environment and is converted to an unwanted compounds. For nearly all metals, oxidation
in air is a thermodynamically favourable process at room temperature. If the oxidation
process is not inhibited, it can be very destructive. However, oxidation can also result in

the formation of an insulating protective oxide layer that prevents further reaction of the
underlying metal. For example, on the basis of the standard reduction potential for Al3+,
we would expect aluminium metal to be readily oxidized. The exceptional stability of this
metal in air is due to the formation of a thin protective coat of oxide (a hydrated form of
Al2O3) on the surface of the metal. The oxide coat is impermeable to the passage of O2 or
water and so protects the underlying metal from further corrosion. Magnesium metal is
similarly protected.
Corrosion of Iron
The most familiar example of corrosion is the rusting of iron. Oxygen gas and water must
be present for iron to rust. Although the reactions involved are quite complex and not
completely understood, the main steps are believed to be as follows:
A region of the metal's surface serves as the anode, where oxidation occurs.
Anode : Fe(s) → Fe2+ (aq) + 2e– ;
The electrons given up by iron reduce atmospheric oxygen to water at the cathode, which
is another region of the same metal surface.
Cathode : O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e– → 2H2O(l);
The overall reaction is
2Fe(s) + O2(g) + 4H+(aq) → 2Fe2+(aq) + 2H2O(l)
With data from Table 4.2, we find the standard emf for this process:
E°cell = E°red (cathode) – E°red (anode)
 = 1.23 V –(–0.44 V)
 = +1.67 V
Note that this reaction occurs in an acidic medium, and the H+ ions are supplied, in part, by
the reaction of atmospheric carbon dioxide with water to form H2CO3.
Can you write the dissociation of carbonic acid in water?
The Fe2+ ions formed at the anode are further oxidized by oxygen:
4Fe2+(aq) + O2(g) + (4 + 2x) H2O(l) → 2Fe2O3. xH2O(s) + 8H+(aq)

This hydrated form of iron (III) oxide is known as rust. The amount of water associated
with the iron oxide varies, so we represent the formula as Fe2O3.xH2O. Figure 4.13
shows the mechanism of rust formation.

Unit Summary
• Oxidation is loss of electrons, and reduction is gain of electrons.
• A reduced substance is an oxidizing agent and an oxidized substance is a
reducing agent.
CHEMISTRY GRADE 12

• Redox reactions are balanced, using the oxidation number change method
or the ion- electron method.
• Metals can conduct electricity because they have delocalized electrons, and
electrolytes can also conduct electricity, due to the presence of free ions.
• In the electrolytic cell, electrical energy is used to bring about a chemical
change.
• The cathode is the electrode at which reduction takes place and the anode is
the electrode at which oxidation takes place.
• In an electrolytic cell, the anode is positive and the cathode is negative. In
Galvanic cells, the electrode polarity is reversed.
• The preferential discharge of ions is affected by the nature of the electrodes,
the position of the ions in the electrochemical series and the concentration
of the ions in the electrolyte.
• In the electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, sodium is discharged at the
cathode, and chlorine is released at the anode. But, in the electrolysis of
concentrated brine solution, hydrogen is discharged at the cathode, and
chlorine is discharged at the anode.
• In the electrolysis of dilute sodium chloride solution and dilute sulphuric
acid solution, hydrogen gas discharges at the cathode and oxygen gas
discharges at the anode.
• The Faraday's Laws are used to calculate the amount of substance deposited
or liberated at the cathode or anode during electrolysis.
• Some of the applications of electrolysis are electroplating, electrorefining
and extraction of metals and non-metals.
• A Galvanic cell is a device in which chemical energy is transformed to
electrical energy.
• A salt bridge preserves the electroneutrality of a solution.
• A cell notation allows us to describe a Galvanic cell without drawing a
diagram. The anode is written on the left and the cathode on the right.
• Cell potential is the difference between the electrode potentials of the cathode
and anode
